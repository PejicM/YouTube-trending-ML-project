      "Description: Teenage climate activist Greta Thunberg accused political and business leaders of polishing their images with clever accounting and creative PR rather than taking concrete action in the fight against climate change at the United Nations Climate Change Conference COP25 summit on Wednesday in Madrid.She ended off her speech with a message: This is what I want you to focus on. So, please tell me how do you react to these numbers without feeling at least some level of panic? How do you respond to the fact that basically nothing is being done about this without feeling the slightest bit of anger? And how do you communicate this without sounding alarmist? I would really like to know.Thunberg has become a symbol of youth anger against older generations and the political classes for foot-dragging over the environmental crisis.For more info, please go to http://www.globalnews.ca\r",

Stand up against people who judge others and use your voice - WEAR IT OUT LOUD! merch back in stock! SHOP http://storybooth.com/store  LIMITED QUANTITIES! When Aliyah was 15 years old, she moved in with her mother after her father passed away. It was so difficult for her to deal with her loss, and to make things even more stressful, Aliyah had to go to a brand new school after her move. On her first day, she was so scared to start her new high school and meet new people. She was really shy. But one day, she met a boy named Aaron. Aaron knew Aliyah's mom through his job, so they immediately had a connection. They became really good friends, and they eventually started dating. They got really close, and Aliyah ended up falling deeply in love with him. He was her first boyfriend and real relationship. One day, when Aaron and Aliyah were home alone, after watching anime, playing video games and hanging out, they decided to take their relationship to the next level. They went to her room, and one thing led to another.  A few weeks later, Aliyah was with her best friend when she started to feel a pain in her stomach. When she went to the bathroom, she realized that she was experiencing a pregnancy symptom. She immediately got really nervous, so she called Aaron and he brought her a pregnancy test. Aliyah took the test a few times, and she became even more nervous and confused when the results were both positive and negative. She didn't know if she was pregnant. Aliyah went to the doctor with her mom to get an official test. After waiting nervously, Aliyah finally got the results - she was not pregnant. Even though she had mixed emotions at first, Aliyah decided that everything ultimately worked out for the best. She did not feel ready to have a baby and become a mother at the time. When she looks back, she probably says to herself, My pregnancy scare was a moment I'll never forget.

      "Description: It is FINALLY time to collect my brand new AMG GT R PRO! After a long wait, how better to collect the new supercar than for the first time using my AMG G63 with a trailer to transport it to Topaz for PPF to be installed. There's going to be a lot of adventures to come with the Pro, I can't wait! Kicking off from the garage, the first stop is to take my AMG G63 over to Topaz, where the Skin was installed, but also to meet with Tony from Turbo Transport to hook up the trailer with which we're going to be collecting the new car. Having passed my test earlier in the summer for towing this type of setup, it's time to finally put it to use and how better than one AMG to collect another!?Logistically, a meet point at Topaz would make our day flow best, but also mean that Tony would be able to show me the ropes and help with the actual work to load and transport the new GT R Pro. We set off then to head towards Mercedes-Benz Brentford to take a first look at the new Shmeemobile.On display sits the GT R Pro, one of only 750 total cars being made, with mine in designo Diamond White paintwork with the satin grey decals to contrast the main colour, along with the titanium RXE wheels and the exposed visual carbon fibre. Powered by the 4.0l TT V8, the Pro shares a similar setup to the G63 with 585hp but features a 7spd dual clutch as opposed to the 9spd auto used by the G for extra torque and off-roading.Why not just drive it? Well as always with my cars, to prevent the risk of stone chips or damage, the car is immediately going to Topaz for the very best installation of Paint Protection Film to ensure it is always going to be in perfect shape. With horrible weather, and weird things happening on the roads around the time of year, not only does it protect the car but also gives an opportunity to use the G63 to tow. As such we unload back at Topaz before Tony is back on his way and it's time for the GT R Pro to head inside for detailing and the PPF install which we will see over the coming week or two.If you're interested to know more about finance, and/or receive a quote, take a look at Shmee150 Finance powered by Harrington: http://www.shmee150finance.comA special thanks to GT (my salesman at MB Brentford), to Topaz and of course to Turbo Tony for his time to show me the ropes for my first towing outing, give him a follow here:http://instagram.com/turbotransportThanks for watching, TimSubscribe: http://bit.ly/Shmee150YTWebsite: http://www.shmee150.comShop: http://shop.shmee150.comInstagram: http://www.instagram.com/shmee150Facebook: http://www.facebook.com/shmee150\n",

Well it all started in the outro of this video https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AyLPMhp7qbs where we wondered if anyone was still watching the video at that point, and to comment 44 (Scott's fave number) if they were. Brett then said 44 Club get on board and the rest is history. The 44Club is the official How Ridiculous fan club made up of people who love our videos and watch them right to the very end. We've even got 44 Club merch now! So yeh, that's the story. Pretty random but good fun at the same time.\r",

      "Description: Leader of the Brexit Party Nigel Farage's reaction to the exit poll.The Brexit Party is not expected to win any seats tonight but party leader Nigel Farage tells the BBC's Andrew Neil: If we get Brexit, we've done a good job.However, he adds that if Boris Johnson's Brexit deal passes unamended I can't bring myself to support it.He thinks it'll result in a closer relationship with the EU going forward than he'd like.My purpose was to try to get right kind of Brexit - if we get half a loaf out of it - that is what we achieved, he says.Asked if he will now step down from politics, he says: Let's see where we are in six months - I may have to throw my hat back into the ring.On his own vote, he says he couldn't bring himself to support the Conservatives so he spoiled his ballot paper.How I voted under this system is pretty irrelevant, he adds attacking first-past-the-post.Please subscribe HERE http://bit.ly/1rbfUogThe Conservatives are set to win an overall majority of 86 in the general election, according to an exit poll for the BBC, ITV and Sky News.The survey taken at UK polling stations suggests the Tories will get 368 MPs - 50 more than at the 2017 election - when all the results have been counted.Labour would get 191, the Lib Dems 13, the Brexit Party none and the SNP 55.The Green Party will still have one MP and Plaid Cymru will lose one seat for a total of three, the survey suggests.The first general election results are due before midnight, with the final total expected to be known by Friday lunchtime.\n",

      "Description: On Episode 5 of UFC 245 Embedded, welterweight champion Kamaru Usman receives support from heavyweight Francis Ngannou. Featherweight champion Max Holloway gets a haircut from his longtime barber, and opponent Alexander Volkanovski does an outdoor photo shoot. Bantamweight Hall of Famer Urijah Faber feels fresh ahead of a bout in which he‚Äôs the underdog. The stars of the night‚Äôs three title fights attend Ultimate Media Day for interviews and faceoffs. Bantamweight champion Amanda Nunes and Germaine de Randamie have kind words for one another ahead of their championship bout, but the opposite is true for Usman and Colby Covington.

Do you want a franken-cake at your wedding? Should we keep doing bad culinary science or retire our spatulas for good?You can check out our Colourpop frankenlipsticks here! https://colourpop.com/collections/safiya-nygaard-makeupThank you so much to Rosanna Pansino for helping us bake our cake!

      "Description: Watch the NEW trailer for #TopGun: Maverick starring Tom Cruise - In theatres June 26, 2020. After more than thirty years of service as one of the Navy‚Äôs top aviators, Pete ‚ÄúMaverick‚Äù Mitchell (Tom Cruise) is where he belongs, pushing the envelope as a courageous test pilot and dodging the advancement in rank that would ground him. When he finds himself training a detachment of Top Gun graduates for a specialized mission the likes of which no living pilot has ever seen, Maverick encounters Lt. Bradley Bradshaw (Miles Teller), call sign: ‚ÄúRooster,‚Äù the son of Maverick‚Äôs late friend and Radar Intercept Officer Lt. Nick Bradshaw, aka ‚ÄúGoose.‚Äù Facing an uncertain future and confronting the ghosts of his past, Maverick is drawn into a confrontation with his own deepest fears, culminating in a mission that demands the ultimate sacrifice from those who will be chosen to fly it.

      "Description: Sources and further reading:https://sites.google.com/view/sourcesoverpopulationandafricaFor most of our history, the human population grew slowly. Until new discoveries brought us more food and made us live longer. In just a hundred years the human population quadrupled. This led to  apocalyptic visions of an overcrowded earth. But the population growth rate actually peaked in the 1960s. Since then, fertility rates have crashed as countries industrialize and develop. World population is now expected to balance out at around 11 billion by the end of the century.   But the big picture conceals  the details. Let us look at one region in particular: Sub-Saharan Africa. In 2019 it was home to a billion people living in 46 countries. Although its growth rate has slowed down in the last few decades, it is still much higher than in the rest of the world.While some projections expect around 2.6 billion people others reckon with up to 5 billion by 2100. Such growth would be a huge challenge for any society. But Sub-Saharan Africa is also the poorest region on earth. So is Sub-Saharan Africa doomed? And why do the projections vary by 2.4 billion people?

(Subscribe: https://bit.ly/C4_News_Subscribe) He insisted the focus would be on the NHS.But his landslide victory puts Brexit right back on the immediate agenda - the Withdrawal Bill likely to go before MPs next week. And it will put Scottish independence front and centre too - thanks to a resurgent SNP.As for Labour - with their worst result since the thirties, the political recriminations begin - and the search for a new leader.-----------------------  Follow us on Instagram - https://www.instagram.com/Channel4News\n",

I watched it myself, hoping to see the YouTube rewind of yesteryear, where it felt like a celebration of the Creator community. Alas, no. This year was so disconnected from that concept, more a top ten list than a recap of our platform's milestones. Why though? Why has this become YouTube's new norm - and yes, this is now the norm. YouTube is sending us all a message with this rewind, and all of its responses to the recent changes on the platform, that it is not one of us Creators.

      "Description: Chili. It's delicious. Especially when you learn to make this simple recipe yourself. Or when you manipulate a friend to make beef chili for you. Also, beans. Who knew some people feel so strongly about beans in beef chili. I did. I feel strongly that I like chili with or without beans. The Book of Babish https://www.bingingwithbabish.com/cookbookYSAC Book and shop: http://yousuckatcooking.comSubscribe: http://bit.ly/1HuynlYhttp://instagram.com/yousuckatcookinghttps://twitter.com/yousuckatcookinAlright to make this chili do something like this: Brown around two pounds of beef by putting your skillet on medium high with a teaspoon of oil which you may not need if you beef is more fatty. Break it up in the pan then let it sit until a crust starts to form, then flip and do the same thing again Dice a large onion and chop it up Do the same with three cloves of garlicHeat your chili pot on medium with some olive oil then saut√© the onion until it starts to brownThrow the garlic in during the last couple of minutesThen add the beef with a teaspoon of salt and break it up moreAdd in 28oz/790g crushed tomatoes2 tablespoon chili powder1 tablespoon cumin 1 to 1.5 cups beef broth‚Ä¶adjust as necessary ¬Ω tablespoon of brown sugar15.5oz/439g chatty bastard kidney beansThen add hot sauce or more spice as desired. Then add toppings, which don‚Äôt count as chili ingredients, because they are on top, not inside. They‚Äôre not really a part of the chili. The chili is it‚Äôs own thing. It‚Äôs like calling ketchup a hot dog. Ketchup isn‚Äôt a hot dog. It‚Äôs ketchup. It has it‚Äôs own life. Don‚Äôt argue with me here. It will get you nowhere and it will just waste both of our times. Especially if you‚Äôre right.\n",

      "Description: By Beck  |  Subscribe: http://bit.ly/sub2storybooth | Comment, like, share this story.  Stand up against people who judge others and use your voice - WEAR IT OUT LOUD! merch back in stock! SHOP http://storybooth.com/store  LIMITED QUANTITIES! One day, Beck received a message from her friend about someone she should add on social media. Beck didn't know the person, but her friend told her that if she connected with him, he would give her free money online. Beck decided to go for it - the idea of free money got her really excited. When she added the man, he started messaging her and offering her money right away. He promised to treat her right, but then he started asking her weird questions. He asked her for her shoe size, height, age - lots of personal details about Beck. Beck responded, but she gave him fake information. Then, the man asked Beck for inappropriate pictures she wasn't comfortable with. When she denied his request, he responded by saying that he would still give her the money if she sent his profile to 5 of her friends that were girls - they HAD to be girls. The promise of free money was too hard for her to pass up, so she sent his information to some friends. Some of her friends thought it was sketchy and didn't add him, but some of them did. When it was time for Beck to get the money he promised her, he asked her for her address. Then, at that moment, Beck made a big mistake - she sent him her REAL address. Beck's friends freaked out and started telling him that her address was fake, which made him extremely angry. He started sending Beck scary, threatening messages. At that point, Beck realized she made a huge mistake. Beck decided to show her school officer the messages and screen shots, and Beck's school decided to call the police. Beck was even more upset when the police told her that the man she was talking to was likely a criminal, and the whole situation was really scary for her. She regretted giving out any personal information, and the entire experience taught her what it means to stay safe online.When she looks back now, she can say to herself, A stranger offered me money on social media - and it taught me an important lesson.Record your story @ https://storybooth.com or our iPhone app for a chance to get animated.______What's your true story?  storybooth wants to hear it!

      "Description: I just got out of The Rise of Skywalker. Here's my full review.Kylo Ren (Adam Driver) and Rey (Daisy Ridley) performed well and so did Ian McDiarmid, as Palpatine. What did you think of the film by itself? What about as the ending to the sequel trilogy? What about in conclusion to the whole Skywalker Saga?SHOP MERCH - https://teespring.com/stores/swtheory Official Website - https://www.starwarstheory.comJOIN - https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC8CbFnDTYkiVweaz8y9wd_Q/joinInstagram - https://www.instagram.com/star.wars.theory/?hl=enTwitter - https://twitter.com/SWTheory66NEW PODCAST iTunes¬† -¬†https://apple.co/2RjWMrhSpotify¬†-¬†https://spoti.fi/2IHHEQAOfficial SWT Discord - https://discord.gg/wexyr6f/subreddit - https://www.reddit.com/r/StarWarsTheorySub/Patreon - https://www.patreon.com/StarWarsTheoryPayPal / e-mail - starwarstheory66@gmail.com__________________________________________Gaming Channel - https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCMI5ojH8j_CqftUjCjfgd-A#riseofskywalker #episode9 #starwars\n",

      "Description: Tory MP Eddie Hughes followed on from former minister Tracey Crouch's humble offering to the Queen.The relative newcomer Mr Hughes, MP for Walsall North, started things off by expressing his shock at how full the Commons is - he says he's used to addressing a near-empty room.He also made a cheeky request for favouritism - to much laughter - from the new Speaker Sir Lindsay Hoyle.If you like what you hear, Mr Speaker, over the next few minutes I like to think you will call me early in debates, unlike your much-loved predecessor [ex-Speaker John Bercow].He also makes plenty of early digs at the Labour Party, reminiscing greatly on the moment of joy he felt when the Conservatives took Blyth Valley from Labour on election night.The camera shows a decidedly glum opposition bench of Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn and shadow home secretary Diane Abbott.#EddieHughes#HouseOfCommons#GE2019\n",

      "Description: The Queen is setting out the Conservative government's agenda for the year ahead, following last week's decisive election win.Legislation to take the UK out of the EU on 31 January is among more than 30 bills being announced during Thursday's State Opening of Parliament.Other measures include guarantees on extra health service funding and longer sentences for violent criminals.PM Boris Johnson says he wants to unite the UK and level up opportunity.Downing Street said an ambitious programme of far-reaching domestic reforms would be put before MPs, with education and infrastructure among other priorities.But Labour said the government would be judged on how far it made up for years of underfunding of the health service and, so far, its proposals fell short of what was needed to deal with rising waiting times and staff vacancies.Please subscribe HERE http://bit.ly/1rbfUog\n",

      "Description: Hey guys!!! I'm back with another episode of squishy makeovers. This is a good one! I made some creations, I'm really proud of, I hope you guys like them just as much as I do.Welcome to another episode of squishy makeovers, where I transform ugly, used, old, dirty, cheap or unwanted squishies (donated by my subscribers) into my own creations. I repair, paint and cut away for hours on end to complete these. Hopefully you like them. Get used to lots of rainbow and sprinkles, because I am addicted to both!PICKLE PRE-ORDER: https://creators.teespring.com/moriah-elizabeth-pickle-plushie/_________FAQs__________1. CAN I SEND YOU SQUISHIES?So many generous people have sent me their unwanted squishies so I actually have a lot to work on already, BUT if you desperately want to, you can request my mailing address in the email ALLLL the way at down in the description (sorry for the traveling), make sure to read the disclaimer down there as well.2. ARE SQUISHIES RETURNED TO THE SENDERS AFTER THE MAKEOVER?No. These squishies  are sent as donations to the series because they were damaged, and no longer wanted. Everyone has been informed in advance that squishies would not be returned. It would be waaay too complicated/expensive and massively time consuming to keep track of everyone and return each squishy. I'm just one person! 3. WHAT PAINT DO YOU USE?I use fabric paint. Fabric paint is meant to stretch, so it is perfect for squishing! Any brand will work fine, but I mainly use Tulip. You can find it at Michaels, Hobby Lobby, A.C. Moore, Walmart, Joann Fabrics, and Online.5. WILL FABRIC PAINT CRACK?The matte fabric paint is more likely to crack after lots of squishing. Slick fabric paints never crack. But there are benefits to both. I usually mix the two paints together to get the best of both worlds.6. CAN I USE ACRYLIC PAINT ON SQUISHIES?I would not recommend that. Acrylic paint will either make the squishy hard, or it will crack and flake off very easily. ___________WELCOME TO MY CHANNEL__________\r",

      "Hey! my name is Moriah (pronounced muh-rye-yuh üòÇ ) and this is my channel....obviously. I'm 25 and like doing anything creative...and being snarky.....just a lil. I make a lot of decorating and painting videos here. I'm obsessed with editing and adding lil bits to my videos, so if that's not your thing....oof you may hate this haha. I paint on squishies, thrift store finds, and other random things I pick up. I also love to draw, but don't expect anything too skilled, I'm not the best at that haha. You will also find occasional crafting/testing crafting kits on my channel which are always a hot mess. And even some baking (REALLY bad at that, but it's fun to try LOL). \r",

      "Description: Sources and further reading:https://sites.google.com/view/sources-stellar-enginesGet your Stellar Engine Infographic Poster here:https://shop.kurzgesagt.orgNothing in the Universe is static. In the milky way, billions of stars orbit the galactic center.Some, like our sun, are pretty consistent, keeping a distance of around 30,000 light years from the galactic center, completing an orbit every 230 million years.This dance is not an orderly ballet -  more like a skating rink filled with drunk toddlers. This chaos makes the galaxy dangerous. Our solar neighbourhood is constantly changing, with stars moving hundreds of kilometers every second.Only the vast distances between objects protect us from the dangers out there. But we might get unlucky in the future. At some point we could encounter a star going supernova. Or a massive object passing by and showering earth with asteroids.If something like this were to happen we would likely know thousands, if not millions of years in advance. But we still couldn‚Äôt do much about it.Unless‚Ä¶ we move our whole solar system out of the way.Support us on Patreon so we can make more videos (and get cool stuff in return): https://www.patreon.com/Kurzgesagt?ty=hSteady: https://steadyhq.com/de/kurzgesagtMerchandise:  https://shop.kurzgesagt.org Newsletter: http://eepurl.com/cRUQxzFacebook: http://bit.ly/1NB6U5OTwitter: http://bit.ly/2DDeT83Instagram: http://bit.ly/2DEN7r3Discord: https://discord.gg/cB7ycdvThe Voice of Kurzgesagt: Steve Taylor: http://voice-pool.com/en/english/The music of the video here: Soundcloud: https://bit.ly/34L3USGBandcamp: https://bit.ly/38YgiC5Youtube: https://bit.ly/2CZ6PeNFacebook: http://bit.ly/2qW6bY4 THANKS A LOT TO OUR LOVELY PATRONS FOR SUPPORTING US:Patrick Hall, Evan Wenden, riz, Nick Rose, Kevin, Patrick Huizinga, Mike Chang, Deddy Jobson, David Nir, Danny Mill, Kai Hebeler, Gabriel Averett, Pierre Xavier, Rohan Kapoor, Bray Demonbreun, Olivier L, Jared Capelle, Mike, Pierre Krenn, Kristofer Kirss, The Captain, –ò–º—è—è –§–∞–º–∏–ª–∏—è—è, Marie Samira, Hekmon, Dsurian, Martina, William Wold, Carston Cook, Daniel Bruce, Milan Juza, michal pol, Dmitry Sadakov, Brian Tieskoetter, kagami suigin, Rosamelia, Amir Johnson, Spencer Byars, Jarrod Parsons, Tayler Martin, bmwniquester, Saito Nakamura, Arnulf Kraan, Emilia Liu, Roosevelt Perry, Frank Blood, M√°t√© Szab√≥, Kasper Kylm√§l√§, Zach Riddle, Damian Campbell, XeleX55, Johann Pardanaud, Cemil Urganci, 3theNet\n",

      "Description: The longest-living person was a woman who made it 122 years and 164 days. Which isn‚Äôt bad for a species with an average lifespan of 72 years. There was also a cat that set the record for the feline community by living to 38 years. Yet dogs aren‚Äôt so lucky, which means we humans, who‚Äôve dubbed these loveable creatures as our best friends, really feel the sting. A 13-year-old person has their whole life ahead of them, yet a 13-year-old dog is considered a senior at that age! While we humans take up to 18 years to stop growing and developing, a dog is usually full-grown at 18 months!

Large dogs 5:42Circling before lying down 7:56Rolling around in the grass 8:11#dogs #pets #brightsideSUMMARY:- Most dogs live on average from 10 to 13 years, depending on the breed, of course.- For the 1st year of their life, dogs age 15 human years! Then they age about 4 human years with each birthday. - Aristotle believed that elephants lived longer than mice because they contained more liquid. Of course, the moisture thing wasn‚Äôt right, but his observations were pretty accurate overall: bigger animals do tend to live longer than smaller ones.- But let‚Äôs consider our parrot friends. They have an average lifespan of 20 to 50 years! - Larger species living longer could simply be a result of where they stand on the food chain.  It takes elephants longer to grow because hardly anyone would dare to attack them, right?- Humans and canines have been friends for thousands of years. DNA suggests that wolves and dogs split around 100,000 years ago. - There‚Äôs a theory suggesting that dogs don‚Äôt live as long because they‚Äôre just so sociable! They live in packs, right? The way it usually goes is when a species lives in groups, they‚Äôre more likely to spread illnesses.- Large species like Saint Bernards and German Shepherds are more prone to hip dysplasia. Siberian Huskies can often develop immune problems. - Also, some breeds are younger than others, and they haven‚Äôt had enough time to evolve. The good thing is that our favorite animals are living longer these days than they used to. - Does your dog take a treat or a big cheekful of food from its bowl only to carry into another room to eat? Like a lot of strange things your dog does, it‚Äôs ancient instincts controlling their brain.- And that circling ritualistic thing they do before they lie down? Spinning in circles might happen for several reasons. - What about rolling around in the grass? When they smell something in the grass they can hunt, they‚Äôll use the grass to mask their own scent and sneak up on their prey.

      "Description: After a Post Office lorry pushed a car sideways down the A40 dual carriageway in London AND it was later revealed the driver was from Car Throttle AND celebrity singer Ellie Goulding happened to be passing by... we haven't stopped debating and hypothesising at Yiannimize.When Daniel from Ashville Construction got involved in the debate he offered to bring one of his Scania tractor unit's down to try to analyse the possibilities. Was this an amazingly outlandish stunt for publicity (that we're jealous of) or simply a crazy coincidence of circumstances?Was this a slow-mo T-Bone / unintentional PIT maneuver? Has any other cabin or impact video surfaced yet? How did the truck driver not see or hear the VW Golf for almost 1 mile? #TBone  |  #Analysis  |  #CarCrash:: ASHVILLE ::YT ¬ª http://youtube.com/channel/UC-2XiVy5AbEn2TXf0f2APeQIG ¬ª @daniellouisy | @ashvilleconcrete | @ashvilleaggregates :: THIS VIDEO ::¬ª https://youtu.be/yQRCPByEAmE:: YIANNIMIZE :: ¬ª http://yiannimize.com ¬ª http://youtube.com/yiannimize ¬ª http://facebook.com/yiannimize ¬ª http://instagram.com/yiannimize ¬ª http://twitter.com/yiannimize\n",

      "Description: Shaka Hislop and Craig Burley break down Chelsea's 2-0 win over Tottenham, propelling Frank Lampard's side to fourth in the Premier League. Hislop believes Lampard coached circles around Jose Mourinho while Burley says he hasn't seen Tottenham play that poorly in a long time. Burley also thinks Chelsea had more desire on the day and wonders when Mourinho's honeymoon period will end if Tottenham's players continue to perform this way.#ESPNFC‚úî Subscribe to ESPN FC on YouTube: http://bit.ly/SUBSCRIBEtoESPNFC\n",

      "Description: In this feature length finale episode, the MCM boys get to work on making a slow car as fast as they can for as cheap as possible. We don't do Patreon or crowd funding, but you can support the show by grabbing something from our online store - we ship worldwide and pack the products and send them from Sydney, Australia. MCM STORE: http://www.mightycarmods.com/collections/‚áæFacebook: http://www.facebook.com/mightycarmods‚áæForum: http://forums.mightycarmods.comAlso something to note around Mighty Car Mods: we are normal guys and are not trained mechanics. We like to make interesting car mods and show you how we've gone about it, but we can't promise that anything we show you will work for your particular car, or that you won't harm yourself, someone else, your car or your warranty doing it. Please be safe, be responsible and unless you know what you're doing, do not fool around with very serious machinery just because you've seen us make it look so easy. Talk to a qualified mechanic if you are in any doubt.\n",

Also the film that taught early 00's Americans about a great many British mainstays, including (but not limited to) banoffee pie: a sweet, sticky, toffee-and-banana-laden confection easily thrown together with some pantry staples.

Now as you guys may know, I went shopping for my wedding dress a few moons ago - and we found a very wonderful white bat-sleeved dress. However, I've been teasing the idea here and there of doing a white swan/black swan moment and having a second *black* reception dress to change into for the party portion of the evening. So that is what we're going to be working on now!Thank you so much to Stephanie White of Odylyne the Ceremony, who you can check out here!https://www.instagram.com/odylynetheceremony/And thank you once again to Christy Baird of LOHO Bride, who you can check out here!https://www.instagram.com/loho_bride/You can check out our Colourpop frankenlipsticks here! https://colourpop.com/collections/safiya-nygaard-makeupDon‚Äôt forget to click the bell to turn on post notifications!Merch: https://fiendsbysaf.com/Safiya's IG: https://www.instagram.com/safiyany/Twitter: https://twitter.com/safiyajnFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/safnygaard/Assistant Editors: Emily Linden, Claire Wiley, Josie Latino, & Ben Chrobak-PrinceMusicvia Audio NetworkSFXVia Audioblocks\n",

Nicol calls Liverpool a machine and says they were a joy to watch in their Boxing Day performance. Hislop adds that Liverpool showed why they have been so dominant the last 12 months and are the deserving Premier League title front-runner. Marcotti refuses to admit Liverpool will go on to win the Premier League title, saying a lot could happen between now and the end of the season.For all the latest from ESPN FC TV, be sure to sign up for ESPN+: https://plus.espn.com/‚úî Subscribe to ESPN FC on YouTube: http://bit.ly/SUBSCRIBEtoESPNFC\n",

      "Description: It's time for another petrol vs electric drag race!  Mats rolled up in the Mercedes-AMG GLC 63 S, and he's going up against the Audi RS5 Sportback and Tesla Model 3 Performance! They've all got slightly different body shapes, but there's one thing they have in common... They're all FAST! The GLC 63 S is the most expensive at ¬£88k, but will its 4.0-litre twin-turbo V8 help it overcome the RS5 and the Model 3? Or perhaps the Tesla's dual electric motors will give it the edge? There's only one way to find out... Let's RACE!

      "Description: Wolverhampton Wanderers became the first team outside the Premier League‚Äôs ‚Äúbig six‚Äù to complete the double over Manchester City since Everton in 2010-11 with a come-from-behind win over Pep Guardiola‚Äôs side at Molineux. ESPN FC‚Äôs Steve Nicol, Shaka Hislop and Julien Laurens break down what went wrong for Man City, particularly at the back, as mistakes by the likes of Benjamin Mendy and Nicolas Otamendi led to goals for Wolves. (3:47) They also examine the VAR decisions that impacted the match and (9:42) whether City has any chance of getting something out of this season by winning the Champions League.#ESPNFC #PremierLeagueFor more from ESPN FC TV, subscribe to ESPN+: https://plus.espn.com/ \r",

This thing is allegedly the biggest chocolate selection box in the world and retails at a whopping ¬£47!Now if you've been following the channel a long time, you'll know I'm terrible at eating chocolate. In fact I don't think I've ever succeeded in eating over 2kg of chocolate, but what the hey...It's Christmas!***NEW VIDEOS EVERY THURSDAY AND SUNDAY AT 7PM GMT***FOLLOW ME:Facebook/Twitter/Instagram: @BeardMeatsFoodFOLLOW MRS BEARD:Instagram: @Mrs_Beard_EatsALL-NEW MERCHANDISE IS CURRENTLY AVAILABLE VIA TEESPRING (USE THE MERCHANDISE SHELF ABOVE OR SEARCH 'BEARDMEATSFOOD TEESPRING').ANSWERS TO COMMON QUESTIONS & ADDITIONAL INFO:Q: How come you don‚Äôt get fat? A: I eat like this for 1 hour of a 168 hour long week.

We  have a lot of work on our hands to get this f450 prepped for paint but we are super excited to be at this stage. We have to decided to paint this thing here at the gonzquad garage where we had some good luck with many previous paint jobs.

      "Description: Buying my Dad his dream car and surprising him with it out of nowhere was one of the best things I have ever done in my life. I surprised my dad with a new car and he did not expect it at all!  We saved over 75% off of MSRP by not buying it from the dealership! With luxury cars it's better to let someone else buy it new and take the huge depreciation hit first. Then you can buy it at an amazing price with low mileage and just a few years old. We wrapped the car with an Indulgent Blue wrap to make it look amazing and we learned how to change the oil in an exotic car to save a ton of money!*All-in-one* used car search website: https://www.AutoTempest.comWhere I got the large model car: https://amzn.to/2Q8ByxzBlue Wrap I got: https://amzn.to/39nBDoQFerrari Motor Oil: https://amzn.to/2Q71lX8Portable Socket Set: https://amzn.to/36aMj8oOil Lab Test Kit: https://www.blackstone-labs.com/Pre Purchase Inspection Checklist: https://goo.gl/uqaWYaI Finally Bought My Dream Car: https://youtu.be/Z5x22ef7A-w‚Üí As an Amazon Associate I earn from qualifying purchases.‚Üí Become a ChrisFix Subscriber: http://www.youtube.com/subscription_center?add_user=paintballoo7‚Üí Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/chrisfixit‚Üí Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/chrisfix8‚Üí Website: http://www.ChrisFixed.com‚Üí My Channel Home Page: https://www.youtube.com/ChrisFix**If the video was helpful, remember to give it a thumbs up and consider subscribing.**Disclaimer:Due to factors beyond the control of ChrisFix, I cannot guarantee against improper use or unauthorized modifications of this information.

She had the courage to share with us that she wants to pursue other career paths outside of YouTube and has made the decision to move on from the band. Of course, none of us wanted her to leave but we will always support her and love her no matter where life takes her. We wish her well with all her ventures and we hope you guys will too. This has been a very difficult decision for all of us to process and we know it‚Äôll be tough for you guys too but please be kind as we all move forward. We really appreciate your kindness during this time.The door will always be open for her if she ever wants to return. We love her as a sister first, and we always will. We remain very close to her as her family.We are grateful for the 10 years that we had with her in the band and we wish her the best in her new chapter of life.Rest assured that Cimorelli will continue in 2020 onward with the other 5 of us. 2019 was one of the best years ever for Cimorelli and we are so grateful we had Dani as a part of it. We will do our best to move forward and kick butt in our new format and we look forward to sharing many new projects with you all in 2020. We will be grieving right alongside all of you but will also do our best to uplift you guys along the way with our new projects.Love you guys and thank you for understanding.- Cimorelli\n",

But as The Wall Street Journal and Gizmodo have reported, these same companies are currently teaming up with fossil fuel industry to help them squeeze as much oil and gas out of the ground as possible. Oil has always been hard to find and hard to extract, and so the industry has teetered precariously on the edge of profitability several times over the course of its history. Over and over again, experts have predicted that we'll soon run out of accessible, affordable oil - but so far, they've been wrong. Just when things look bleakest for black gold, new technology swoops in to keep the industry afloat.Vox.com is a news website that helps you cut through the noise and understand what's really driving the events in the headlines.

Now over a year later, we're going to tear apart the brakes and look at all the most vulnerable components under a microscope to see if they degraded or changed in any way.This video is just for entertainment, and I can't recommend that you fill your brakes with baby oil. With that said, this will always be the baby oil fat bike and it will always have baby oil in the brakes until they fail. Maybe it's time we name this bike...

      "Description: More Celebrity News ‚ñ∫‚ñ∫ http://bit.ly/SubClevverNewsThe Golden Globes had plenty of funny, shocking, and awkward moments. But what really got me were the emotional moments. I kid you not, I shed a couple tears tonight!What‚Äôs up? It‚Äôs Drew Dorsey here with Clevver News and award season is officially underway!There were so many moments to talk about, but I‚Äôm here to talk about the tear jerking moments. And grab your tissues because emotions were running high!Let‚Äôs start with Tom Hanks who was honored with the Cecil B. DeMille award.It was a huge honor and just the montage before his acceptance speech was enough to get me emotional. But his speech set me over the edge.When he thanked his wife there wasn‚Äôt a dry eye in the audience or at home. You have to see it for yourself.I mean, my heart can‚Äôt take it! And neither could fans on Twitter.One person said quote, ‚ÄúHARD TO NOT CRY WHEN TOM HANKS CRIES.‚ÄùAnd another said quote, ‚ÄúI MEAN. WOW. #TomHanks is a worldwide treasure and we need to protect him at all costs. Also, excuse me while I wipe up the entire lake of tears I shed during his speech. @tomhanks‚ÄùBRB still crying over this entire moment.And if that wasn‚Äôt enough to make you shed a tear, let‚Äôs talk about Kate McKinnon presenting Ellen DeGeneres with the Carol Burnett Award.She opened up about how Ellen made her feel comfortable with her sexuality and how she‚Äôs paved the way for many people in the LGBTQ+ community in Hollywood.And fans are really connecting with this moment as well.One person tweeted saying quote, ‚ÄúI became super emotional watching Ellen DeGeneres--that people sought to dim her light is unacceptable. All I can say is, Equality is non-negotiable. And @RepHartzler --your discriminatory + hateful views on the LGBTQ+ community have no place in Congress.‚ÄùAnd another said quote, ‚ÄúIt was amazing, and so was Kate Mckinnon‚Äôs introduction. It was just what I needed today. The world needs more Ellen‚Äôs.‚ÄùAnd we couldn‚Äôt agree more!The last emotional moment we will talk about for today, because I don‚Äôt want you all crying too much, is Jennifer Anniston talking about the Australian fires.Many celebs brought attention to the tragic fires that are currently happening in Australia.Jenn read Russell Crowe‚Äôs acceptance speech for him because he is back home in Australia helping his family affected by the fires.She got choked up when reading it and fans talked about this moment on Twitter.One fan tweeted saying quote, ‚ÄúNo, YOU were getting emotional watching Jennifer Aniston fighting off tears reading Russell Crowe's acceptance speech on the Australia fires.‚ÄùAnd another said quote, ‚ÄúJennifer Aniston did a superb job hosting and reading out Russel Crowe‚Äôs message with sincerity and empathy‚ÄùAnd we totally get it. The fires are tragic and we‚Äôd like to help however we can.In our description we‚Äôve linked some ways to donate and get involved. Please consider donating if you are able to!And I want to hear from you all which moment made you cry the most.Was it Tom Hanks or Kate McKinnon or someone else?Let me know down in the comments below.After that, why don‚Äôt you dive in to more Clevver News by hitting that subscribe button and click that bell so you don‚Äôt miss any of our new stories.

      "Description: TaylorMade SIM Drivers & TaylorMade SIM Max Drivers 2020 In this video Rick Shiels PGA Golf Professional reviews the brand new TaylorMade Golf SIM driver & TaylorMade Golf SIM Max driver. In 2020 TaylorMade Golf are releasing 3 new drivers the TaylorMade SIM driver, the TaylorMade SIM Max and The TaylorMade SIM Max D type driver. Rick Shiels heads to the driving range, the golf course and to Quest Golf Academy to test the drivers and see if they do actually hit the golf ball longer, hit the golf ball straight and help swing the golf club faster. Rick tests the driver using Titleist PRO V1 golf balls and Foresight GC Quad. The TaylorMade Golf SIM driver and TaylorMade Golf SIM Max driver will be played by golfers on The European Tour, The PGA Tour as well as The Masters, The USPGA, The US Open and The Open. Some of the best golfers in the world such as Dustin Johnson, Tiger Woods, Rory McIlroy, Jason Day and John Rahm will be using the new drivers BUT are they actually any better than the TaylorMade Golf M5 driver?

I also want to make you play better golf by providing coaching video on all topics about golf, how to fix your slice, fix your hook, help you drive the golf ball longer, hit your irons more pure, hit your irons closer to the hole and help you draw and fade your golf shots. I will also help you lower your score by chipping better by stopping you duff and thin chips, pitch the ball closer and also create backspin. Also I will provide you help to putt better and hole more putts! On this channel I also make fun and entertaining golf content based on crazy and sometimes ‚Äúgimmicky‚Äù golf clubs. I like to cut through the marketing hype about products and I like to give you the honest truth about golf equipment. If you enjoy the channel make sure you hit subscribe and also tap the notification bell so that you are always notified when I release a new video.\n",

      "Description: The pull-up is one of the most commonly performed, and misperformed, exercises in the gym. In this video, I‚Äôm going to show you how to never do them incorrectly again and give you the fixes for the 10 most common pullup mistakes.  Whether you can do 10 pull-ups or more now or struggle to do one, you‚Äôll find this incredibly helpful and I guarantee you will be doing more reps by the time the video is over.The first thing you need to be aware of is how you are gripping the bar. If you grip too narrow you will shift the focus of the movement from the stronger back muscles to the weaker muscles of the forearms. You want to make sure you are just outside of shoulder width with the hand placement for optimal performance on this exercise.That said, the brachioradialis and brachialis are muscles that are going to be contributing to the pullup and your ability to do the most reps possible so you are going to need to train them. You just don‚Äôt want them being the main drivers of the exercise. To supplement your back muscles in the exercise, be sure to include some cross body hammer curls as shown to increase the strength of the forearms and your overall strength on the pullup.Regarding the grip placement, it isn‚Äôt enough to just get the hand spacing down. You also want to be sure that you direct your pressure in the right way. Most people simply pull straight down on the bar or worse, they pull outwards because they‚Äôve been told this will increase the activation of the lats. Both of these aren‚Äôt optimal. The best thing you can do is squeeze your hands inward towards each other and down at the same time. This will engage much more upper body muscle activation that will make your body feel as if it is floating up above the bar on every rep, instantly.Much of this has to do with plugging kinetic looseness (or energy leaks as I call them). You can take this even a step further by contracting other areas of your body that often get ignored during the exercise like your legs, ankles and core. Instead of dangling from the bar and letting your knees hang loosely, tighten you quads, point your feet down and really contract your core muscles and you will see an instant improvement in your ability to lift your body up over the bar.Now you don‚Äôt want to take these measures and then let it all loosen up when you get to the bottom of the rep. Most importantly, you do not want to get lax during the hanging portion of the pullup. This will place too much strain on the shoulders and is called unpacking. Instead, even though you want to get fully straightened at the elbows you want to keep your shoulder blades pulled down and back to create shoulder stability. This will allow for a lifetime of injury free pullups and more growth from the exercise.There are other biomechanical flaws that you will want to avoid with your pullups that I cover here but I also want to point out a couple of the programming issues that are often done incorrectly as well. For instance, you don‚Äôt want to always save your pullups for the end of your workout. Too often, because they are a bodyweight exercise, we save them for after we have already done our rows, deadlifts or pulldowns. You will never get the most out of the exercise when done in a fatigued state like this. Try moving them to the front of your workout and you will be surprised at how quickly you see gains just by making the switch.Finally, the exercise like any other, will respond to intensification techniques like drop sets and changes in the weight used during it. Use a band to accommodate your fatigue and get more total reps done in a workout - either as a drop set or as a simple lightening of the load as you would with any other traditional back exercise in your workout.If you‚Äôre looking for a program that will help you to do many more pullups while at the same time getting you in the best overall shape of your life, head to athleanx.com at the link below and follow the same step by step training that has created ripped athletic bodies for men and women of all ages and all levels of athleticism.

      "Description: Eighteen year old Curtis Jones became a Merseyside derby hero for Liverpool with his incredible goal in a 1-0 win vs. Everton in the third round of the FA Cup. ESPN FC‚Äôs Shaka Hislop breaks down how a mixture of Liverpool youth and reserve players managed to get the better of a nearly-full-strength Everton squad that had the better of the chances in the first half. Hislop says the second-half performance should give Jurgen Klopp more confidence when he needs to rotate his squad as Liverpool continue on in the FA Cup, Premier League and Champions League.#ESPNFC #FACupSubscribe to ESPN UK: http://bit.ly/1oGUzVA\r",

When asked on the BBC One's Andrew Marr Show whether Labour should become the party of rejoining the EU, Phillips said: 'If our country is safer, if it is more economically viable to be in the EU, then I will fight for that.'

      "Description: Watch the full show on PBS: https://www.pbs.org/video/dave-chappelle-the-kennedy-center-mark-twain-prize-qbmxgn/ An outstanding lineup of entertainers gathered in the Kennedy Center Concert Hall to salute Dave Chappelle, recipient of the 22nd annual Mark Twain Prize for American Humor on October 27, 2019. The Prize, which is named to honor one of the world‚Äôs greatest humorists, was given at a gala performance featuring some of the biggest names in comedy. https://www.kennedy-center.org/pages/specialevents/marktwainDave Chappelle is an internationally recognized stand-up comedian and actor whose trademark wit and sharp, irreverent social commentary explores race, popular culture, sex, drugs, politics, and fame. Arguably the most-touring comic on the circuit, Chappelle has performed more than 1,600 concerts worldwide in the past four years, selling out shows within minutes of their announcements.Dave Chappelle could always make people laugh. Once he realized the power of his natural talent, he set some ambitious goals for his art. As a 14-year-old student at Washington, D.C.'s Duke Ellington School of the Arts, Chappelle crafted his stand-up comedy act out of the realities of his life growing up Black in the nation's capital.ABOUT THE MARK TWAIN PRIZEThe Mark Twain Prize recognizes people who have had an impact on American society in ways similar to the distinguished 19th century novelist and essayist best known as Mark Twain. As a social commentator, satirist and creator of memorable characters, Samuel Clemens was a fearless observer of society, who startled and outraged many while delighting and informing many more with his uncompromising perspective of social injustice and personal folly. He revealed the great truth of humor when he said against the assault of laughter nothing can stand.The inaugural Mark Twain Prize was presented to Richard Pryor during the first annual Kennedy Center Celebration of American Humor, October 20, 1998. The event was created by the John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts, Bob Kaminsky, Peter Kaminsky, Mark Krantz, and John Schreiber and is televised annually. The Kennedy Center is grateful to Cappy McGarr for his steadfast support of the Mark Twain Prize for American Humor since its inception. Previous recipients of the Mark Twain include Richard Pryor (1998), Jonathan Winters (1999), Carl Reiner (2000), Whoopi Goldberg (2001), Bob Newhart (2002), Lily Tomlin (2003), Lorne Michaels (2004), Steve Martin (2005), Neil Simon (2006), Billy Crystal (2007), George Carlin (2008), Bill Cosby (2009, rescinded in 2018) Tina Fey (2010), Will Ferrell (2011), Ellen DeGeneres (2012), Carol Burnett (2013) Jay Leno (2014), Eddie Murphy (2015), Bill Murray (2016), David Letterman (2017), and Julia Louis-Dreyfus (2018). #MarkTwainPrize #DaveChappelle #MTPSubscribe to The Kennedy Center! http://bit.ly/2gNFrtb\n",

      "Description: According to the U.S. government, evidence is mounting that an Iranian missile was responsible for the crash of a passenger plane near Tehran Wednesday. Iran denies the charge, but the U.S. says radar, satellite and photos indicate it is highly likely -- raising the question of why civilian aircraft were flying amid a conflict.

      "Description: A new video as emerged which appears to show the moment a Ukrainian passenger jet was shot down in Iran. Originally obtained by the New York Times, the phone footage shows a tiny spec suddenly exploding. The light disappears before the sound of impact can be heard just over 20 seconds later. All 176 people on board were killed. The plane crashed hours after Iran targeted US military assets in neighbouring Iraq.

The statement explained how the couple plan to split their time between the UK and North America after ‚Äúmonths of reflection‚Äù. According to reports, no other royals, including the Queen or Prince William, were consulted before the statement was released. As well as reacting to the shock news, the Loose Women will be asking if Harry and Meghan's relationship can survive this royal rift and the huge upheaval that's to come.From series 24, broadcast on 09/01/20Like, follow and subscribe to Loose Women!Website: http://bit.ly/1EDGFp5YouTube: http://bit.ly/1C7hxMyFacebook: http://on.fb.me/1KXmWdcTwitter: http://bit.ly/1Bxfxtshttp://www.itv.comhttp://www.stv.tv\n",

      "Description: Gotham‚Äôs worst brings out their best. Meet Harley Quinn, Black Canary, Huntress, Renee Montoya, and Cassandra Cain. #BirdsOfPrey in theaters 2.7.20. https://www.facebook.com/BirdsOfPreyMovie https://twitter.com/birdsofpreywb https://www.instagram.com/BirdsOfPrey/ https://www.birdsofpreymovie.com/  You ever hear the one about the cop, the songbird, the psycho and the mafia princess?  ‚ÄúBirds of Prey (And the Fantabulous Emancipation of One Harley Quinn)‚Äù is a twisted tale told by Harley herself, as only Harley can tell it.  When Gotham‚Äôs most nefariously narcissistic villain, Roman Sionis, and his zealous right-hand, Zsasz, put a target on a young girl named Cass, the city is turned upside down looking for her.  Harley, Huntress, Black Canary and Renee Montoya‚Äôs paths collide, and the unlikely foursome have no choice but to team up to take Roman down.  In the Warner Bros. Pictures film, Margot Robbie (‚ÄúI, Tonya‚Äù) returns as Harley Quinn, alongside Mary Elizabeth Winstead (‚Äú10 Cloverfield Lane,‚Äù TV‚Äôs ‚ÄúFargo‚Äù) as Huntress; Jurnee Smollett-Bell (HBO‚Äôs ‚ÄúTrue Blood‚Äù) as Black Canary; Rosie Perez (‚ÄúFearless,‚Äù ‚ÄúPitch Perfect 2‚Äù) as Renee Montoya; Chris Messina (‚ÄúArgo,‚Äù TV‚Äôs ‚ÄúSharp Objects‚Äù) as Victor Zsasz; and Ewan McGregor (upcoming ‚ÄúDoctor Sleep,‚Äù the ‚ÄúTrainspotting‚Äù films) as Roman Sionis.  Newcomer Ella Jay Basco also stars as Cassandra ‚ÄúCass‚Äù Cain in her feature film debut. Directed by Cathy Yan (‚ÄúDead Pigs‚Äù) from a script by Christina Hodson (‚ÄúBumblebee‚Äù), the film is based on characters from DC.  Robbie also produced, alongside Bryan Unkeless and Sue Kroll.  The film‚Äôs executive producers are Walter Hamada, Galen Vaisman, Geoff Johns, Hans Ritter and David Ayer. Joining Yan behind the scenes was a creative team comprised of director of photography Matthew Libatique (‚ÄúA Star Is Born,‚Äù ‚ÄúVenom‚Äù); production designer K.K. Barrett (‚ÄúHer‚Äù); editor Jay Cassidy (‚ÄúAmerican Hustle,‚Äù ‚ÄúSilver Linings Playbook‚Äù) and editor Evan Schiff (‚ÄúJohn Wick Chapters 2 & 3‚Äù); and costume designer Erin Benach (‚ÄúA Star Is Born‚Äù).  The music is by Daniel Pemberton (‚ÄúSpider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse‚Äù). Warner Bros. Pictures Presents a LuckyChap Entertainment Production, a Clubhouse Pictures Production, a Kroll & Co. Entertainment Production, ‚ÄúBirds of Prey (and the Fantabulous Emancipation of One Harley Quinn).‚Äù  Opening in theaters and IMAX nationwide on February 7, 2020, the film will be distributed by Warner Bros. Pictures.\n",

      "Description: Hey! Today I'm going to be customizing 3 different iphone cases. I'm painting on phone cases with acrylic paint, using some different styles and techniques including abstract design and semi-realism. Hope you like rainbows, cute animals (or demon animals), fruit and desserts!It's been a trend recently to paint directly on the iphone, but I think I'm going to stick with the cases for now üòÇ I really want to learn more about how to customize different items and how to make painted surfaces more practical for everyday use. So if any of you have any knowledge of what kind of techniques or products I can use to prep different painting surfaces, please let me know!Also, if you guys really love any of the phone case designs, I could work on getting the design printed on actual phone cases to put in my shop!

I make a lot of decorating and painting videos here. I'm obsessed with editing and adding lil bits to my videos, so if that's not your thing....oof you may hate this haha. I paint on squishies, thrift store finds, and other random things I pick up. I also love to draw, but don't expect anything too skilled, I'm not the best at that haha.

      "Description: Rachel Nichols breaks down the Twitter fight between former Thunder teammates Kendrick Perkins and Kevin Durant after Perk said Russell Westbrook was the best player Oklahoma City ever had. Perkins (3:43) starts by apologizing to Westbrook for overshadowing his return to OKC and clarifies that he does not believe that Russ is a better overall player than KD, but stands by the comments he made. Chauncey Billups adds that he doesn‚Äôt like the fact that people on Twitter were able to come between the brotherhood that Perk and Durant share.‚úî Subscribe to ESPN+ https://plus.espn.com/‚úî Get the ESPN App: http://www.espn.com/espn/apps/espn‚úî Subscribe to ESPN on YouTube: http://es.pn/SUBSCRIBEtoYOUTUBE‚úî Subscribe to ESPN FC on YouTube: http://bit.ly/SUBSCRIBEtoESPNFC‚úî Subscribe to NBA on ESPN on YouTube: http://bit.ly/SUBSCRIBEtoNBAonESPN‚úî Watch ESPN on YouTube TV: http://es.pn/YouTubeTVExclusive interviews with Rachel Nichols https://urlzs.com/jNUReStephen A.
