When Aliyah was 15 years old, she moved in with her mother after her father passed away. It was so difficult for her to deal with her loss, and to make things even more stressful, Aliyah had to go to a brand new school after her move. On her first day, she was so scared to start her new high school and meet new people. She was really shy. But one day, she met a boy named Aaron. Aaron knew Aliyah's mom through his job, so they immediately had a connection. They became really good friends, and they eventually started dating. They got really close, and Aliyah ended up falling deeply in love with him. He was her first boyfriend and real relationship. One day, when Aaron and Aliyah were home alone, after watching anime, playing video games and hanging out, they decided to take their relationship to the next level. They went to her room, and one thing led to another.  A few weeks later, Aliyah was with her best friend when she started to feel a pain in her stomach. When she went to the bathroom, she realized that she was experiencing a pregnancy symptom. She immediately got really nervous, so she called Aaron and he brought her a pregnancy test. Aliyah took the test a few times, and she became even more nervous and confused when the results were both positive and negative. She didn't know if she was pregnant. Aliyah went to the doctor with her mom to get an official test. After waiting nervously, Aliyah finally got the results - she was not pregnant. Even though she had mixed emotions at first, Aliyah decided that everything ultimately worked out for the best. She did not feel ready to have a baby and become a mother at the time. When she looks back, she probably says to herself, My pregnancy scare was a moment I'll never forget.

The singing competition series is hosted by Nick Cannon and features panelists Jenny McCarthy, Nicole Scherzinger, Ken Jeong and Robin Thicke.The show features celebrities facing off against one another with one major twist: each singer is shrouded from head to toe in an elaborate costume, complete with full face mask to conceal his or her identity. Season Two boasts 16 celebrity singers in all-new costumes and masks, including The Flamingo, The Leopard and The Egg.With each performance, the host, panelists, audience, viewers and even the other contestants are left guessing who is singing behind the mask. Ranging from Grammy Award winners to legendary athletes, and everything in between, the singers may attempt to throw the crowd off of their scent, while keen observers might pick up on tiny clues buried throughout the show. One singer will be eliminated each week, ultimately revealing his or her true identity.

Chu‚Äôs lively and authentic eye for storytelling to capture a world very much of its place, but universal in its experience. ‚ÄúIn the Heights‚Äù stars Anthony Ramos (‚ÄúA Star is Born,‚Äù Broadway‚Äôs ‚ÄúHamilton‚Äù), Corey Hawkins (‚ÄúStraight Outta Compton,‚Äù ‚ÄúBlacKkKlansman‚Äù), singer/songwriter Leslie Grace, Melissa Barrera (TV‚Äôs ‚ÄúVida‚Äù), Olga Merediz (Broadway‚Äôs ‚ÄúIn the Heights‚Äù), Daphne Rubin-Vega (Broadway‚Äôs ‚ÄúRent‚Äù), Gregory Diaz IV (Broadway‚Äôs ‚ÄúMatilda the Musical‚Äù), Stephanie Beatriz (TV‚Äôs ‚ÄúBrooklyn Nine-Nine‚Äù), Dascha Polanco (TV‚Äôs ‚ÄúOrange is the New Black‚Äù) and Jimmy Smits (the ‚ÄúStar Wars‚Äù films). Chu is directing the film from a screenplay by Quiara Alegr√≠a Hudes; it is based on the musical stage play, with music and lyrics by Lin-Manuel Miranda, book by Quiara Alegr√≠a Hudes and concept by Miranda. ‚ÄúIn the Heights‚Äù is produced by Miranda and Hudes, together with Scott Sanders, Anthony Bregman and Mara Jacobs. David Nicksay and Kevin McCormick served as executive producers. Behind the camera, Chu is reuniting with his ‚ÄúCrazy Rich Asians‚Äù production designer, Nelson Coates, and editor, Myron Kerstein. He is also collaborating with director of photography Alice Brooks (TV‚Äôs ‚ÄúThe Walking Dead‚Äù) and costume designer Mitchell Travers (‚ÄúEighth Grade‚Äù).  The choreography is by Christopher Scott, who previously teamed with Chu on the award-winning ‚ÄúThe Legion of Extraordinary Dancers.‚Äù ‚ÄúIn the Heights‚Äù was filmed in New York, primarily on location in the dynamic community of Washington Heights.  Slated for release on June 26, 2020, it will be distributed worldwide by Warner Bros. Pictures.",5,Entertainment,1,14,Thursday

Until new discoveries brought us more food and made us live longer. In just a hundred years the human population quadrupled. This led to  apocalyptic visions of an overcrowded earth. But the population growth rate actually peaked in the 1960s. Since then, fertility rates have crashed as countries industrialize and develop. World population is now expected to balance out at around 11 billion by the end of the century.   But the big picture conceals  the details. Let us look at one region in particular: Sub-Saharan Africa. In 2019 it was home to a billion people living in 46 countries. Although its growth rate has slowed down in the last few decades, it is still much higher than in the rest of the world.While some projections expect around 2.6 billion people others reckon with up to 5 billion by 2100. Such growth would be a huge challenge for any society. But Sub-Saharan Africa is also the poorest region on earth. So is Sub-Saharan Africa doomed? And why do the projections vary by 2.4 billion people?

Stand up against people who judge others and use your voice - WEAR IT OUT LOUD! merch back in stock! SHOP http://storybooth.com/store  LIMITED QUANTITIES! One day, Beck received a message from her friend about someone she should add on social media. Beck didn't know the person, but her friend told her that if she connected with him, he would give her free money online. Beck decided to go for it - the idea of free money got her really excited. When she added the man, he started messaging her and offering her money right away. He promised to treat her right, but then he started asking her weird questions. He asked her for her shoe size, height, age - lots of personal details about Beck. Beck responded, but she gave him fake information. Then, the man asked Beck for inappropriate pictures she wasn't comfortable with. When she denied his request, he responded by saying that he would still give her the money if she sent his profile to 5 of her friends that were girls - they HAD to be girls. The promise of free money was too hard for her to pass up, so she sent his information to some friends. Some of her friends thought it was sketchy and didn't add him, but some of them did. When it was time for Beck to get the money he promised her, he asked her for her address. Then, at that moment, Beck made a big mistake - she sent him her REAL address. Beck's friends freaked out and started telling him that her address was fake, which made him extremely angry. He started sending Beck scary, threatening messages. At that point, Beck realized she made a huge mistake. Beck decided to show her school officer the messages and screen shots, and Beck's school decided to call the police. Beck was even more upset when the police told her that the man she was talking to was likely a criminal, and the whole situation was really scary for her. She regretted giving out any personal information, and the entire experience taught her what it means to stay safe online.When she looks back now, she can say to herself, A stranger offered me money on social media - and it taught me an important lesson.Record your story @ https://storybooth.com or our iPhone app for a chance to get animated.______What's your true story?  storybooth wants to hear it!

Break it up in the pan then let it sit until a crust starts to form, then flip and do the same thing again Dice a large onion and chop it up Do the same with three cloves of garlicHeat your chili pot on medium with some olive oil then saut√© the onion until it starts to brownThrow the garlic in during the last couple of minutesThen add the beef with a teaspoon of salt and break it up moreAdd in 28oz/790g crushed tomatoes2 tablespoon chili powder1 tablespoon cumin 1 to 1.5 cups beef broth‚Ä¶adjust as necessary ¬Ω tablespoon of brown sugar15.5oz/439g chatty bastard kidney beansThen add hot sauce or more spice as desired. Then add toppings, which don‚Äôt count as chili ingredients, because they are on top, not inside. They‚Äôre not really a part of the chili. The chili is it‚Äôs own thing. It‚Äôs like calling ketchup a hot dog. Ketchup isn‚Äôt a hot dog. It‚Äôs ketchup. It has it‚Äôs own life. Don‚Äôt argue with me here. It will get you nowhere and it will just waste both of our times.

Cosmological natural selection proposes exactly this - but even better, it claims to be able to test the hypothesis.Sign Up on Patreon to get access to the Space Time Discord! https://www.patreon.com/pbsspacetimeCheck out the Space Time Merch Storehttps://pbsspacetime.com/Physicists have been struggling for some time to figure out why our universe is so comfy. Why, for example, are the fundamental constants - like the mass of the electron or the strength of the forces - just right for the emergence of life? Tweak them too much and life, stars, galaxies, the universe as we know it wouldn‚Äôt exist. In recent episodes we explored one possible explanation for this - the anthropic principle and the idea of the multiverse. If there are countless universes with different fundamental constants, then it‚Äôs not surprising that a few exist with the right numbers for life - and certainly not surprising that we find ourselves in one of those good ones. But if you don‚Äôt like the anthropic principle - and many scientists don‚Äôt - then rest assured, there‚Äôs an alternative. You only need to accept two things: that our universe formed inside a black hole, and that universes can evolve.Hosted by Matt O'DowdWritten by Matt O'DowdGraphics by Leonardo Scholzer & Adriano LealDirected by: Andrew KornhaberExecutive Producers: Eric Brown & Andrew KornhaberSpecial Thanks to our Patreon Sponsors: Big BangAndrew & BrennaAlexander TamasCraig StonahaDavid BarnholdtDavid NicklasFabrice EapJohn SJuan BenetMorgan HoughQuasarMark HeisingVinnie FalcoHypernovaChuck ZegarDanton SpiveyDonal BotkinEdmund FokschanerHank SJohn HofmannJohn PollockJohn R.

The singing competition series is hosted by Nick Cannon and features panelists Jenny McCarthy, Nicole Scherzinger, Ken Jeong and Robin Thicke.The show features celebrities facing off against one another with one major twist: each singer is shrouded from head to toe in an elaborate costume, complete with full face mask to conceal his or her identity. Season Two boasts 16 celebrity singers in all-new costumes and masks, including The Flamingo, The Leopard and The Egg.With each performance, the host, panelists, audience, viewers and even the other contestants are left guessing who is singing behind the mask. Ranging from Grammy Award winners to legendary athletes, and everything in between, the singers may attempt to throw the crowd off of their scent, while keen observers might pick up on tiny clues buried throughout the show. One singer will be eliminated each week, ultimately revealing his or her true identity.

Does more expensive mean more better? And is it worth it?Donut bought two identical 350z‚Äôs and we have been modifying them to be fun, daily drivers that you can take to the track.James Pumphrey and Zach Jobe are on Team Hi, and their Z gets the expensive parts. Nolan Sykes and Aaron Parker are on Team Low, and their 350z gets the cheap parts. Afterwards, the teams test them to see which components are actually worth spending the money on. So far, we‚Äôve installed coilovers and new wheel and tire combos on the 350Zs, and now we‚Äôre moving on to brakes. The ability to stop well is probably one of the more underrated features of a car. But if you‚Äôre planning some serious go-fast mods, like the turbo kits coming soon, or you want to turn yourself into a track rat, braking should be a priority. It‚Äôs just plain safer. And if you‚Äôre looking for the fastest possible laps, being able to brake harder and later means you‚Äôll be shaving off time. So we want to see what kind of results we can get from a really basic brake upgrade versus a full super expensive brake kit. This time, Nolan and Aaron are getting a lot less total stuff for their money. Their $450 basic brake upgrade kit just comes with drilled and slotted rotors, braided stainless steel brake lines, Centric Posi Quiet brake pads for the street, and some Motul brake fluid. Low Car is keeping its stock sliding calipers, which aren‚Äôt quite as confidence-inspiring as opposed-piston calipers. Their design makes them flex more, so the pedal might not feel as good as James‚Äô will after his brake upgrade. Hi Team is getting a full-on, 4-wheel upgrade with Wilwood 6-piston front calipers and 2-piston rear calipers, bigger 13-inch front rotors, pads, and braided stainless lines to the tune of $4400.Is more expensive more better?

I'm back with another episode of squishy makeovers. This is a good one! I made some creations, I'm really proud of, I hope you guys like them just as much as I do.Welcome to another episode of squishy makeovers, where I transform ugly, used, old, dirty, cheap or unwanted squishies (donated by my subscribers) into my own creations. I repair, paint and cut away for hours on end to complete these. Hopefully you like them. Get used to lots of rainbow and sprinkles, because I am addicted to both!PICKLE PRE-ORDER: https://creators.teespring.com/moriah-elizabeth-pickle-plushie/_________FAQs__________1. CAN I SEND YOU SQUISHIES?So many generous people have sent me their unwanted squishies so I actually have a lot to work on already, BUT if you desperately want to, you can request my mailing address in the email ALLLL the way at down in the description (sorry for the traveling), make sure to read the disclaimer down there as well.2. ARE SQUISHIES RETURNED TO THE SENDERS AFTER THE MAKEOVER?No. These squishies  are sent as donations to the series because they were damaged, and no longer wanted. Everyone has been informed in advance that squishies would not be returned. It would be waaay too complicated/expensive and massively time consuming to keep track of everyone and return each squishy. I'm just one person! 3. WHAT PAINT DO YOU USE?I use fabric paint. Fabric paint is meant to stretch, so it is perfect for squishing! Any brand will work fine, but I mainly use Tulip. You can find it at Michaels, Hobby Lobby, A.C. Moore, Walmart, Joann Fabrics, and Online.5. WILL FABRIC PAINT CRACK?The matte fabric paint is more likely to crack after lots of squishing. Slick fabric paints never crack. But there are benefits to both. I usually mix the two paints together to get the best of both worlds.6. CAN I USE ACRYLIC PAINT ON SQUISHIES?I would not recommend that. Acrylic paint will either make the squishy hard, or it will crack and flake off very easily. ___________WELCOME TO MY CHANNEL__________Hey! my name is Moriah (pronounced muh-rye-yuh üòÇ ) and this is my channel....obviously. I'm 25 and like doing anything creative...and being snarky.....just a lil. I make a lot of decorating and painting videos here. I'm obsessed with editing and adding lil bits to my videos, so if that's not your thing....oof you may hate this haha. I paint on squishies, thrift store finds, and other random things I pick up. I also love to draw, but don't expect anything too skilled, I'm not the best at that haha. You will also find occasional crafting/testing crafting kits on my channel which are always a hot mess. And even some baking (REALLY bad at that, but it's fun to try LOL). CURRENT SERIES:Squishy Makeovers: Fixing and decorating used squishies sent from my viewersThrift Store Makeovers: Fixing and decorating stuff I find at thrift stores/yard salesBake With ME: Recreating squishies I've decorated in real lifeCreate This Book: Drawing in the prompt book that I wrote (available to purchase and follow along)Squishy Unboxing: Opening used squishy packages sent from viewersCraft Kit Testing: pretty self explanatory. testing craft kits.___UPLOAD SCHEDULE___Every Friday at 4:00pm ET: Alternating Squishy Makeovers, Thrift Makeovers, Craft Kit Reviews, Create This Book, Mail Openings and Miscellaneous crafts and DIYs____PURCHASE ME PRODUCTS____CREATE THIS BOOK:https://amzn.to/2vUerfICREATE THIS BOOK 2:https://amzn.to/2Nx2G9fME MERCHhttps://me-merch.myshopify.comMORE MERCH:https://moriah-elizabeth.teespring.com/____ME SOCIALS____INSTAGRAM: https://www.instagram.com/moriahelizabethofficial/VISIT ME WEBSITE:https://www.moriahelizabeth.com/____CONTACT ME____EMAIL PICTURES OF YOUR ART (Create This Book or Fan art only please):Artwork@Moriah.videoFOR BUSINESS INQUIRIES/OPPORTUNITIES ONLY:Business@Moriah.video_____MAIL ME_____For sending squishies, Letters, or general fan mail, please contact: FANMAIL@MORIAH.VIDEO to request my P.O. box address (mail accepted from those ages 13+ ONLY)ATTENTION: Unfortunately I can only respond to a small amount of people each week.

The singing competition series is hosted by Nick Cannon and features panelists Jenny McCarthy, Nicole Scherzinger, Ken Jeong and Robin Thicke.The show features celebrities facing off against one another with one major twist: each singer is shrouded from head to toe in an elaborate costume, complete with full face mask to conceal his or her identity. Season Two boasts 16 celebrity singers in all-new costumes and masks, including The Flamingo, The Leopard and The Egg.With each performance, the host, panelists, audience, viewers and even the other contestants are left guessing who is singing behind the mask. Ranging from Grammy Award winners to legendary athletes, and everything in between, the singers may attempt to throw the crowd off of their scent, while keen observers might pick up on tiny clues buried throughout the show. One singer will be eliminated each week, ultimately revealing his or her true identity.

In the milky way, billions of stars orbit the galactic center.Some, like our sun, are pretty consistent, keeping a distance of around 30,000 light years from the galactic center, completing an orbit every 230 million years.This dance is not an orderly ballet -  more like a skating rink filled with drunk toddlers. This chaos makes the galaxy dangerous. Our solar neighbourhood is constantly changing, with stars moving hundreds of kilometers every second.Only the vast distances between objects protect us from the dangers out there. But we might get unlucky in the future. At some point we could encounter a star going supernova.

The natural beauty, the friendliness of the people, and the amazingly flavorful food, is what makes Kerala so special. Thanks to Ebbin from Food N Travel (https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC-wTAWLHOWLYyZI9m_JV8zg) who took us on an ultimate food tour of Kerala. Can‚Äôt wait to share all of the videos with you.Kannur - We started in the North of Kerala, the Malabar Coast on the Arabian Sea. Kannur, is a friendly town, laid back, and there‚Äôs plenty of amazing street food to try.Onakkan Bharathi (Puttu Restaurant, Kannur) - We started this Indian street food tour with puttu, mutton curry, and a variety of lentils and chickpeas for breakfast. The combination was fantastic, perfect harmony of spice and flavor. The heat mostly came from black pepper. Total price - 286 INR ($4.03)Kerala crunchy snacks - Thanks to Roshan from Seashell Haris Beach Home in Kannur, for taking us to eat local snacks all drenched in chutney. I wasn‚Äôt all that excited at first for snacks in glass jugs - but the chutney blew me away. Unbelievable flavors coming out of that chutney and pickled snacks. 10 INR ($0.14) - Price per bowlStreet Mussels - Next up on this Kerala street food tour, we went to an afternoon snack stall specializing in mainly hot masala mussels, which were formed into dumpling like shapes, and fried in hot coconut oil. They were superb, as were everything else. 200 INR ($2.81) - Price for everythingChili Soda - Finally to end this food tour of Kannur, we had a soothing chili and coriander soda - they put pickled chillies and coriander in pineapple juice in a soda.

You‚Äôre not alone ‚Äî most people picture the same thing. But we‚Äôre all wrong. Ancient buildings and sculptures were actually really colorful. The Greeks and Romans painted their statues to resemble real bodies, and often gilded them so they shone like gods. So why is seemingly every museum on planet earth full of white marble sculptures? It‚Äôs partly an honest mistake. After the fall of Rome, ancient sculptures were buried or left out in the open air for hundreds of years. By the time the Renaissance began in the 1300s, their paint had faded away. As a result, the artists unearthing, and copying ancient art didn‚Äôt realize how colorful it was supposed to be.But white marble couldn‚Äôt have become the norm without some willful ignorance. Even though there was a bunch of evidence that ancient sculpture was painted, artists, art historians and the general public chose to disregard it. Western culture seemed to collectively accept that white marble was simply prettier. Today, art history is more concerned with accuracy than it is with what might look better. So teams of researchers use a combination of art and science to painstakingly create reconstructions of ancient statues, showing us the true colors of classical antiquity.Most of the reconstruction work shown in this video was done by the Polychromy Research Project, led by conservationists Vinzenz Brinkmann and Ulrike Koch-Brinkmann.

Today I am going to be ranking ALL of the squishy creations that I've made in my squishy makeover series over the las year. This includes 41 squishies from a total of 13 different makeover videos. I have put sooo much time in painting, fixing and decorating all of these. It's been a great year for creating things on my channel! Not only for squishy makeovers, but also my other thrift store finds, baking videos, create this book and other random customization projects. I hope you guys have enjoyed this past year of content from me, it's been fun! I'm looking forward another great year of creative projects.PICKLE PRE-ORDER: https://creators.teespring.com/moriah-elizabeth-pickle-plushie/WATCH THE WHOLE SERIES: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysasQfKtxI0&list=PL807ptvhwHpcHoHa30Lq-uL8Kcxgpa39wFUN FACTS?‚ÄìI did 57 squishies and 14 videos LAST year. So I only did 1 less video this year than last year BUT, I made 16 fewer squishies. I focused more on quality, less on quantity this year!‚ÄìIf you‚Äôre wondering how we are only on episode #19 of squishy makeovers, it‚Äôs because that number only goes with the ‚Äúfixing your squishies‚Äù series.

I'm 25 and like doing anything creative...and being snarky.....just a lil. I make a lot of decorating and painting videos here. I'm obsessed with editing and adding lil bits to my videos, so if that's not your thing....oof you may hate this haha. I paint on squishies, thrift store finds, and other random things I pick up. I also love to draw, but don't expect anything too skilled, I'm not the best at that haha. You will also find occasional crafting/testing crafting kits on my channel which are always a hot mess. And even some baking (REALLY bad at that, but it's fun to try LOL). CURRENT SERIES:Squishy Makeovers: Fixing and decorating used squishies sent from my viewersThrift Store Makeovers: Fixing and decorating stuff I find at thrift stores/yard salesBake With ME: Recreating squishies I've decorated in real lifeCreate This Book: Drawing in the prompt book that I wrote (available to purchase and follow along)Squishy Unboxing: Opening used squishy packages sent from viewersCraft Kit Testing: pretty self explanatory. testing craft kits.___UPLOAD SCHEDULE___Every Friday at 4:00pm ET: Alternating Squishy Makeovers, Thrift Makeovers, Craft Kit Reviews, Create This Book, Mail Openings and Miscellaneous crafts and DIYs____PURCHASE ME PRODUCTS____CREATE THIS BOOK:https://amzn.to/2vUerfICREATE THIS BOOK 2:https://amzn.to/2Nx2G9fME MERCHhttps://me-merch.myshopify.comMORE MERCH:https://moriah-elizabeth.teespring.com/____ME SOCIALS____INSTAGRAM: https://www.instagram.com/moriahelizabethofficial/VISIT ME WEBSITE:https://www.moriahelizabeth.com/____CONTACT ME____EMAIL PICTURES OF YOUR ART (Create This Book or Fan art only please):Artwork@Moriah.videoFOR BUSINESS INQUIRIES/OPPORTUNITIES ONLY:Business@Moriah.video_____MAIL ME_____For sending squishies, Letters, or general fan mail, please contact: FANMAIL@MORIAH.VIDEO to request my P.O. box address (mail accepted from those ages 13+ ONLY)ATTENTION: Unfortunately I can only respond to a small amount of people each week.

Does more expensive mean more better? And is it worth it? Let‚Äôs find out.We bought two identical 350Zs and have been modifying them to be FUN, daily drivers that you can take to the track. James Pumphrey and Zach Jobe are on Team Hi, and their car gets the expensive parts. Nolan Sykes and Aaron Parker are on team Low. Their car gets the cheap ones.Then we test them to see which components are actually worth spending the money on. We‚Äôve been focusing on improving our cars performance, but today we‚Äôre focusing on the interior...performance. So we‚Äôre going to be throwing in new seats, and ALSO adding in roll cages and harnesses.Team Hi got $900 Sparco QRT-R seats.Team Low I got $450 Corbeau FX1 Pro seats.Cars aren‚Äôt necessarily one-size-fits all. Especially small sports cars like our Zs. You might find the stock driving position uncomfortable. Sometimes the seats don‚Äôt hold you well enough going around a corner and you get flung to the side. If you‚Äôve got short legs and a long torso, or long legs and a short torso, things just might not feel right.  That‚Äôs where aftermarket interior parts can come in. A race seat can hold you in place better and make it easier for you to corner hard‚Ä¶ or it can be horribly uncomfortable if it doesn‚Äôt fit your body right. Maybe the more expensive seat has a nicer quality material on it, but the overall shape and size of the seat is really going to be a matter of personal preference. The cheaper seat might be the right choice anyway if it‚Äôs going to be easier to live with and drive in every day.Even though Nolan is going with a cheaper option he didn't go with the cheapest option. All of his stuff is FIA approved.

Here I‚Äôm going to show you why you not only want to stop trying to touch your toes and instead do the move I show you as an alternative. All you have to do is look at the implications this position has for hiding postural flows and imbalances and you will see quickly why it‚Äôs something you will not want to keep doing to help you feel more flexible.It starts by letting you test yourself. Can you actually touch your toes? Many people will be able to, but many more will not. Even if you cannot, I can make it much easier for you if I tell you to be sure you roll your butt underneath you before you attempt to bend down. This will place a lot less of a stretch on the hamstrings making it easier for you to fold.The issue with this modification is that many people do this naturally anyway in order to cheat their way to their toes. This really isn‚Äôt giving them any valuable information regarding their own flexibility and the health of their posture. In fact, it‚Äôs doing them a disservice by convincing them that they are more flexible than they really are and therefore allowing them to shrug off doing anything about it.When you slump forward to touch your toes you are actually initiating much of the range of motion through the thoracic spine. You are flexing forward into severe kyphosis in order to achieve the hands to the toes position. This is only reinforcing a bad tendency for having slumped posture. It gets worse from there however. The low back is forced to round and the pelvis is thrown into a posterior tilt. This is the exact position that someone who is aged and has lost all semblance of good posture will adopt.Even more, the shoulders themselves slump forward and are lacking any kind of scapular stability. All of these issues combined are a recipe for disaster when it comes to proper posture and the insinuation that being able to get into this position of hands to toes is in some way a good thing is misleading to say the least. Instead of being obsessed with whether you can still touch your toes I‚Äôm asking you to try something else.Stand about 3 foot lengths away from the wall and reach forward with one leg until you can prop your toes up against the wall.  Immediately, you should feel a stretch on the calf of that leg and likely already the hamstring. From here, reach your hands up against the wall slightly over shoulder height and place your palms flat against the wall. Simultaneously walk your hands up the wall while leaning your chest in. The goal should be to ultimately touch your chest against the wall without any care towards whether you are bending down or forward. You are simply supposed to reach your chest forward. If you cannot get there, don‚Äôt worry, this is normal. You will however want to work towards getting your chest closer over time. Hold this position for 30 seconds to a minute and don‚Äôt forget to repeat on the other leg to balance out both hamstrings.The benefit to this position rather than the slumped forward posture that bending over to touch your toes places you in is the fact that you can maintain thoracic extension while at the same time keeping your pelvis in an anterior tilt. This position of the pelvis is going to place a higher demand on the hamstrings, however in doing so, will reveal any tightnesses in them that you will want to address rather than hiding them by simply allowing your pelvis to roll back during the stretch.This is just one example where old school methods of measuring and working on your flexibility are not helping you.

But as The Wall Street Journal and Gizmodo have reported, these same companies are currently teaming up with fossil fuel industry to help them squeeze as much oil and gas out of the ground as possible. Oil has always been hard to find and hard to extract, and so the industry has teetered precariously on the edge of profitability several times over the course of its history. Over and over again, experts have predicted that we'll soon run out of accessible, affordable oil - but so far, they've been wrong.

PUyKPpqY2yA,Iran‚Äôs Revolutionary Guard Spokesman Breaks Down Over Soleimani's Death on State TV,2020-01-03 13:57:59,UChirEOpgFCupRAk5etXqPaA,QuickTake by Bloomberg,25,2020-01-04,iran|trump|war|war with iran,296829,1855,1196,3898,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/PUyKPpqY2yA/default.jpg,False,False,"President Donald Trump ordered a U.S. airstrike that killed one of Iran‚Äôs most powerful generals and sent global markets reeling in response to the threat of an ‚Äúimminent attack,‚Äù Secretary of State Michael Pompeo said Friday.Pompeo would not provide details about the threat other than to say it was confined to the Middle East and that it justified the airstrike. Iran‚Äôs Supreme Leader quickly threatened ‚Äúsevere retaliation‚Äù in response. The U.S. State Department has issued a directive urging American citizens to leave Iraq immediately due to the tensions.Oil futures in London and New York at one point surged by more than 4%, gold hit the highest in four months, 10-year Treasury yields headed for the biggest drop in three weeks and stocks and U.S. equity futures slid.Qassem Soleimani, who led proxy militias that extended Iran‚Äôs power across the Middle East, was killed in a strike in Baghdad authorized by Trump, the Defense Department said in a statement late Thursday. Trump, who is staying at Mar-a-Lago resort in Florida, said on Twitter Friday that ‚ÄúIran never won a war, but never lost a negotiation!‚Äù and the U.S. embassy in Baghdad urged its citizens to leave the country.‚ÄúWe don‚Äôt seek war with Iran,‚Äù Pompeo said in an interview on Fox Friday morning. ‚ÄúBut we, at the same time, are not going to stand by and watch the Iranians escalate and continue to put American lives at risk without responding in a way that disrupts, defends, deters and creates an opportunity to de-escalate the situation.‚Äù‚ÄúAt the direction of the president, the U.S. military has taken decisive defensive action to protect U.S. personnel abroad by killing‚Äù Soleimani, the Pentagon said. ‚ÄúGeneral Soleimani was actively developing plans to attack American diplomats and service members in Iraq and throughout the region.‚ÄùPompeo said the decision to strike was based on intelligence collection and that the attack ‚Äúsaved American lives.‚ÄùThe death of Soleimani, who led the Revolutionary Guards‚Äô Quds force, fueled concerns that the U.S. and Iran could be drawn into an armed confrontation that could easily pull in other countries. The pressures, which have been building for months, have been complicated by widespread protests in Iraq and Iran.‚ÄúQassem Soleimani embodied Iran‚Äôs extraterritorial activism in the Middle East,‚Äù said Asif Shuja, a senior research fellow at Singapore‚Äôs Middle East Institute. ‚ÄúHis assassination is thus bound to be a turning point.‚ÄùIran‚Äôs top leaders all condemned the attack and vowed to hit back while Foreign Minister Javad Zarif denounced the killing on Twitter as ‚Äúan act of international terrorism.‚Äù Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei is due to attend an emergency meeting of Iran‚Äôs Supreme National Security Council for the first time, the state-owned Hamshahri newspaper reported. He vowed to avenge Soleimani‚Äôs killing.‚ÄúA severe retaliation awaits murderers who have the blood of Soleimani and that of other martyrs on their wicked hands from last night‚Äôs incident,‚Äù Khamenei said in a statement.The Iranian leadership is signaling that it will likely target U.S. military installations and bases in the Middle East and mobilize its network of militias across the region. One official told the state broadcaster that some 36 U.S. military bases and facilities are within reach of Iran‚Äôs defense forces, with the closest being in Bahrain. A spokesman for the Revolutionary Guards said the assassination marked the start of a ‚Äúnew phase‚Äù in the activities of Iran‚Äôs ‚Äúresistance forces‚Äù throughout the region.A September attack on Saudi oil facilities -- for which Iranian-backed rebels in Yemen claimed responsibility -- highlighted the potential impact of Tehran‚Äôs response.Trump‚Äôs European allies urged the president to find a way to ease the tensions with Tehran and warned of the risks that a cycle of retaliations would spiral out of control.French President Emmanuel Macron is speaking to his counterparts in the Middle East in an effort to prevent the situation spiraling out of control, European Affairs Minister Amelie de Montchalin said on RTL radio. ‚ÄúThis is what we feared,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs a continuation of the escalation that‚Äôs been happening over recent months.‚ÄùGerman Chancellor Angela Merkel‚Äôs spokesman said the U.S. had been provoked by Iran and urged all sides to reduce the tensions.Subscribe to our YouTube channel: https://bit.ly/2TwO8GmQUICKTAKE ON SOCIAL:Follow QuickTake on Twitter: twitter.com/quicktakeLike QuickTake on Facebook: facebook.com/quicktakeFollow QuickTake on Instagram: instagram.com/quicktakeSubscribe to our newsletter: https://bit.ly/2FJ0oQZEmail us at quicktakenews@gmail.comQuickTake by Bloomberg is a global news network delivering up-to-the-minute analysis on the biggest news, trends and ideas for a new generation of leaders.",8,News & Politics,1,13,Friday

It also keeps your body safe, your mind more at ease, and opens up the gates for whatever you are moving toward - to come and meet you, just where you are. When this happens you may find yourself feeling more aligned with the process, and in a happy flow state - no matter what your day is like or what exactly goes down on the yoga mat.

The Prize, which is named to honor one of the world‚Äôs greatest humorists, was given at a gala performance featuring some of the biggest names in comedy. The program will be broadcast on PBS stations on Tuesday, January 7, 2020. https://www.kennedy-center.org/pages/specialevents/marktwainDave Chappelle is an internationally recognized stand-up comedian and actor whose trademark wit and sharp, irreverent social commentary explores race, popular culture, sex, drugs, politics, and fame. Arguably the most-touring comic on the circuit, Chappelle has performed more than 1,600 concerts worldwide in the past four years, selling out shows within minutes of their announcements.Dave Chappelle could always make people laugh. Once he realized the power of his natural talent, he set some ambitious goals for his art. As a 14-year-old student at Washington, D.C.'s Duke Ellington School of the Arts, Chappelle crafted his stand-up comedy act out of the realities of his life growing up Black in the nation's capital.ABOUT THE MARK TWAIN PRIZEThe Mark Twain Prize recognizes people who have had an impact on American society in ways similar to the distinguished 19th century novelist and essayist best known as Mark Twain. As a social commentator, satirist and creator of memorable characters, Samuel Clemens was a fearless observer of society, who startled and outraged many while delighting and informing many more with his uncompromising perspective of social injustice and personal folly. He revealed the great truth of humor when he said against the assault of laughter nothing can stand.The inaugural Mark Twain Prize was presented to Richard Pryor during the first annual Kennedy Center Celebration of American Humor, October 20, 1998. The event was created by the John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts, Bob Kaminsky, Peter Kaminsky, Mark Krantz, and John Schreiber and is televised annually. The Kennedy Center is grateful to Cappy McGarr for his steadfast support of the Mark Twain Prize for American Humor since its inception. Previous recipients of the Mark Twain include Richard Pryor (1998), Jonathan Winters (1999), Carl Reiner (2000), Whoopi Goldberg (2001), Bob Newhart (2002), Lily Tomlin (2003), Lorne Michaels (2004), Steve Martin (2005), Neil Simon (2006), Billy Crystal (2007), George Carlin (2008), Bill Cosby (2009, rescinded in 2018) Tina Fey (2010), Will Ferrell (2011), Ellen DeGeneres (2012), Carol Burnett (2013) Jay Leno (2014), Eddie Murphy (2015), Bill Murray (2016), David Letterman (2017), and Julia Louis-Dreyfus (2018). #MarkTwainPrize #DaveChappelle #MTPSubscribe to The Kennedy Center! http://bit.ly/2gNFrtb",1,Entertainment,1,14,Saturday

It‚Äôs also one of the few awards shows that combines the honorees of both film and television.Ricky Gervais' Monologue - 2020 Golden Globeshttps://youtu.be/LCNdTLHZAeoNBC on YouTubehttp://www.youtube.com/user/nbc",9,Entertainment,0,3,Monday

But what really got me were the emotional moments. I kid you not, I shed a couple tears tonight!What‚Äôs up? It‚Äôs Drew Dorsey here with Clevver News and award season is officially underway!There were so many moments to talk about, but I‚Äôm here to talk about the tear jerking moments. And grab your tissues because emotions were running high!Let‚Äôs start with Tom Hanks who was honored with the Cecil B. DeMille award.It was a huge honor and just the montage before his acceptance speech was enough to get me emotional. But his speech set me over the edge.When he thanked his wife there wasn‚Äôt a dry eye in the audience or at home. You have to see it for yourself.I mean, my heart can‚Äôt take it! And neither could fans on Twitter.One person said quote, ‚ÄúHARD TO NOT CRY WHEN TOM HANKS CRIES.‚ÄùAnd another said quote, ‚ÄúI MEAN. WOW. #TomHanks is a worldwide treasure and we need to protect him at all costs. Also, excuse me while I wipe up the entire lake of tears I shed during his speech. @tomhanks‚ÄùBRB still crying over this entire moment.And if that wasn‚Äôt enough to make you shed a tear, let‚Äôs talk about Kate McKinnon presenting Ellen DeGeneres with the Carol Burnett Award.She opened up about how Ellen made her feel comfortable with her sexuality and how she‚Äôs paved the way for many people in the LGBTQ+ community in Hollywood.And fans are really connecting with this moment as well.One person tweeted saying quote, ‚ÄúI became super emotional watching Ellen DeGeneres--that people sought to dim her light is unacceptable. All I can say is, Equality is non-negotiable. And @RepHartzler --your discriminatory + hateful views on the LGBTQ+ community have no place in Congress.‚ÄùAnd another said quote, ‚ÄúIt was amazing, and so was Kate Mckinnon‚Äôs introduction. It was just what I needed today. The world needs more Ellen‚Äôs.‚ÄùAnd we couldn‚Äôt agree more!The last emotional moment we will talk about for today, because I don‚Äôt want you all crying too much, is Jennifer Anniston talking about the Australian fires.Many celebs brought attention to the tragic fires that are currently happening in Australia.Jenn read Russell Crowe‚Äôs acceptance speech for him because he is back home in Australia helping his family affected by the fires.She got choked up when reading it and fans talked about this moment on Twitter.One fan tweeted saying quote, ‚ÄúNo, YOU were getting emotional watching Jennifer Aniston fighting off tears reading Russell Crowe's acceptance speech on the Australia fires.‚ÄùAnd another said quote, ‚ÄúJennifer Aniston did a superb job hosting and reading out Russel Crowe‚Äôs message with sincerity and empathy‚ÄùAnd we totally get it. The fires are tragic and we‚Äôd like to help however we can.In our description we‚Äôve linked some ways to donate and get involved. Please consider donating if you are able to!And I want to hear from you all which moment made you cry the most.Was it Tom Hanks or Kate McKinnon or someone else?Let me know down in the comments below.After that, why don‚Äôt you dive in to more Clevver News by hitting that subscribe button and click that bell so you don‚Äôt miss any of our new stories.

In this video, I‚Äôm going to show you how to never do them incorrectly again and give you the fixes for the 10 most common pullup mistakes.  Whether you can do 10 pull-ups or more now or struggle to do one, you‚Äôll find this incredibly helpful and I guarantee you will be doing more reps by the time the video is over.The first thing you need to be aware of is how you are gripping the bar. If you grip too narrow you will shift the focus of the movement from the stronger back muscles to the weaker muscles of the forearms. You want to make sure you are just outside of shoulder width with the hand placement for optimal performance on this exercise.That said, the brachioradialis and brachialis are muscles that are going to be contributing to the pullup and your ability to do the most reps possible so you are going to need to train them. You just don‚Äôt want them being the main drivers of the exercise. To supplement your back muscles in the exercise, be sure to include some cross body hammer curls as shown to increase the strength of the forearms and your overall strength on the pullup.Regarding the grip placement, it isn‚Äôt enough to just get the hand spacing down. You also want to be sure that you direct your pressure in the right way. Most people simply pull straight down on the bar or worse, they pull outwards because they‚Äôve been told this will increase the activation of the lats. Both of these aren‚Äôt optimal. The best thing you can do is squeeze your hands inward towards each other and down at the same time. This will engage much more upper body muscle activation that will make your body feel as if it is floating up above the bar on every rep, instantly.Much of this has to do with plugging kinetic looseness (or energy leaks as I call them). You can take this even a step further by contracting other areas of your body that often get ignored during the exercise like your legs, ankles and core. Instead of dangling from the bar and letting your knees hang loosely, tighten you quads, point your feet down and really contract your core muscles and you will see an instant improvement in your ability to lift your body up over the bar.Now you don‚Äôt want to take these measures and then let it all loosen up when you get to the bottom of the rep. Most importantly, you do not want to get lax during the hanging portion of the pullup. This will place too much strain on the shoulders and is called unpacking. Instead, even though you want to get fully straightened at the elbows you want to keep your shoulder blades pulled down and back to create shoulder stability. This will allow for a lifetime of injury free pullups and more growth from the exercise.There are other biomechanical flaws that you will want to avoid with your pullups that I cover here but I also want to point out a couple of the programming issues that are often done incorrectly as well. For instance, you don‚Äôt want to always save your pullups for the end of your workout. Too often, because they are a bodyweight exercise, we save them for after we have already done our rows, deadlifts or pulldowns. You will never get the most out of the exercise when done in a fatigued state like this. Try moving them to the front of your workout and you will be surprised at how quickly you see gains just by making the switch.Finally, the exercise like any other, will respond to intensification techniques like drop sets and changes in the weight used during it. Use a band to accommodate your fatigue and get more total reps done in a workout - either as a drop set or as a simple lightening of the load as you would with any other traditional back exercise in your workout.If you‚Äôre looking for a program that will help you to do many more pullups while at the same time getting you in the best overall shape of your life, head to athleanx.com at the link below and follow the same step by step training that has created ripped athletic bodies for men and women of all ages and all levels of athleticism.

An outstanding lineup of entertainers gathered in the Kennedy Center Concert Hall to salute Dave Chappelle, recipient of the 22nd annual Mark Twain Prize for American Humor on October 27, 2019. The Prize, which is named to honor one of the world‚Äôs greatest humorists, was given at a gala performance featuring some of the biggest names in comedy. https://www.kennedy-center.org/pages/specialevents/marktwainDave Chappelle is an internationally recognized stand-up comedian and actor whose trademark wit and sharp, irreverent social commentary explores race, popular culture, sex, drugs, politics, and fame. Arguably the most-touring comic on the circuit, Chappelle has performed more than 1,600 concerts worldwide in the past four years, selling out shows within minutes of their announcements.Dave Chappelle could always make people laugh. Once he realized the power of his natural talent, he set some ambitious goals for his art. As a 14-year-old student at Washington, D.C.'s Duke Ellington School of the Arts, Chappelle crafted his stand-up comedy act out of the realities of his life growing up Black in the nation's capital.ABOUT THE MARK TWAIN PRIZEThe Mark Twain Prize recognizes people who have had an impact on American society in ways similar to the distinguished 19th century novelist and essayist best known as Mark Twain. As a social commentator, satirist and creator of memorable characters, Samuel Clemens was a fearless observer of society, who startled and outraged many while delighting and informing many more with his uncompromising perspective of social injustice and personal folly. He revealed the great truth of humor when he said against the assault of laughter nothing can stand.The inaugural Mark Twain Prize was presented to Richard Pryor during the first annual Kennedy Center Celebration of American Humor, October 20, 1998. The event was created by the John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts, Bob Kaminsky, Peter Kaminsky, Mark Krantz, and John Schreiber and is televised annually. The Kennedy Center is grateful to Cappy McGarr for his steadfast support of the Mark Twain Prize for American Humor since its inception. Previous recipients of the Mark Twain include Richard Pryor (1998), Jonathan Winters (1999), Carl Reiner (2000), Whoopi Goldberg (2001), Bob Newhart (2002), Lily Tomlin (2003), Lorne Michaels (2004), Steve Martin (2005), Neil Simon (2006), Billy Crystal (2007), George Carlin (2008), Bill Cosby (2009, rescinded in 2018) Tina Fey (2010), Will Ferrell (2011), Ellen DeGeneres (2012), Carol Burnett (2013) Jay Leno (2014), Eddie Murphy (2015), Bill Murray (2016), David Letterman (2017), and Julia Louis-Dreyfus (2018). #MarkTwainPrize #DaveChappelle #MTPSubscribe to The Kennedy Center! http://bit.ly/2gNFrtb",1,Entertainment,1,14,Sunday

The Prize, which is named to honor one of the world‚Äôs greatest humorists, was given at a gala performance featuring some of the biggest names in comedy. https://www.kennedy-center.org/pages/specialevents/marktwainDave Chappelle is an internationally recognized stand-up comedian and actor whose trademark wit and sharp, irreverent social commentary explores race, popular culture, sex, drugs, politics, and fame. Arguably the most-touring comic on the circuit, Chappelle has performed more than 1,600 concerts worldwide in the past four years, selling out shows within minutes of their announcements.Dave Chappelle could always make people laugh. Once he realized the power of his natural talent, he set some ambitious goals for his art. As a 14-year-old student at Washington, D.C.'s Duke Ellington School of the Arts, Chappelle crafted his stand-up comedy act out of the realities of his life growing up Black in the nation's capital.ABOUT THE MARK TWAIN PRIZEThe Mark Twain Prize recognizes people who have had an impact on American society in ways similar to the distinguished 19th century novelist and essayist best known as Mark Twain. As a social commentator, satirist and creator of memorable characters, Samuel Clemens was a fearless observer of society, who startled and outraged many while delighting and informing many more with his uncompromising perspective of social injustice and personal folly. He revealed the great truth of humor when he said against the assault of laughter nothing can stand.The inaugural Mark Twain Prize was presented to Richard Pryor during the first annual Kennedy Center Celebration of American Humor, October 20, 1998. The event was created by the John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts, Bob Kaminsky, Peter Kaminsky, Mark Krantz, and John Schreiber and is televised annually. The Kennedy Center is grateful to Cappy McGarr for his steadfast support of the Mark Twain Prize for American Humor since its inception. Previous recipients of the Mark Twain include Richard Pryor (1998), Jonathan Winters (1999), Carl Reiner (2000), Whoopi Goldberg (2001), Bob Newhart (2002), Lily Tomlin (2003), Lorne Michaels (2004), Steve Martin (2005), Neil Simon (2006), Billy Crystal (2007), George Carlin (2008), Bill Cosby (2009, rescinded in 2018) Tina Fey (2010), Will Ferrell (2011), Ellen DeGeneres (2012), Carol Burnett (2013) Jay Leno (2014), Eddie Murphy (2015), Bill Murray (2016), David Letterman (2017), and Julia Louis-Dreyfus (2018). #MarkTwainPrize #DaveChappelle #MTPSubscribe to The Kennedy Center! http://bit.ly/2gNFrtb",2,Entertainment,0,3,Wednesday

Is the wrap worth the cost? We bought two identical 350Zs and have been modifying them to be FUN, daily drivers that you can take to the track. James Pumphrey and Zach Jobe are on Team Hi, and their car gets the expensive parts. Nolan Sykes and Aaron Parker are on team Low. Their car gets the cheap ones.Then we test them to see which components are actually worth spending the money on.If you want to ‚Äúpaint‚Äù or change the color of your car, you basically have three options- A traditional paint job, a vinyl wrap, or plastidip. The gloss of a paint job is intoxicating, but a perfect paint job like that is not only ridonkulously expensive, but it takes forever. There is so much prep work involved with a paint job like!So Hi Team is taking the happy medium route: they're getting Hi Car professionally vinyl wrapped. $2600 bucks. A quality wrap job is the best of every world. Hardly any prep work. It only takes a few days to get one done, though if you‚Äôre doing it yourself, put your patience-pants on. It protects your paint --if it‚Äôs worth protecting, it‚Äôs totally reversible --for when you change your mind, and you can have any sort of graphic screen printed onto a vinyl wrap. Team Low will be plastidipping their car by hand. Plasti dip offers many of the same benefits as vinyl-wrapping, but for a fraction of the price. We bought this plasti dip kit from ‚Äúdip your car‚Äù for $500. It is California compliant, so that might make it worse. But on the bright side, it is relatively easy to do yourself (or so Nolan thought), there‚Äôs very little prep work, it‚Äôs totally reversible, and it‚Äôs easy to fix damage or mistakes. The only downsides are that it‚Äôs never going to look like a great paint job, it‚Äôs not that durable, and Team Low has to do it themselvesDoes it look $2000 better?

When Gotham‚Äôs most nefariously narcissistic villain, Roman Sionis, and his zealous right-hand, Zsasz, put a target on a young girl named Cass, the city is turned upside down looking for her.  Harley, Huntress, Black Canary and Renee Montoya‚Äôs paths collide, and the unlikely foursome have no choice but to team up to take Roman down.  In the Warner Bros. Pictures film, Margot Robbie (‚ÄúI, Tonya‚Äù) returns as Harley Quinn, alongside Mary Elizabeth Winstead (‚Äú10 Cloverfield Lane,‚Äù TV‚Äôs ‚ÄúFargo‚Äù) as Huntress; Jurnee Smollett-Bell (HBO‚Äôs ‚ÄúTrue Blood‚Äù) as Black Canary; Rosie Perez (‚ÄúFearless,‚Äù ‚ÄúPitch Perfect 2‚Äù) as Renee Montoya; Chris Messina (‚ÄúArgo,‚Äù TV‚Äôs ‚ÄúSharp Objects‚Äù) as Victor Zsasz; and Ewan McGregor (upcoming ‚ÄúDoctor Sleep,‚Äù the ‚ÄúTrainspotting‚Äù films) as Roman Sionis.  Newcomer Ella Jay Basco also stars as Cassandra ‚ÄúCass‚Äù Cain in her feature film debut. Directed by Cathy Yan (‚ÄúDead Pigs‚Äù) from a script by Christina Hodson (‚ÄúBumblebee‚Äù), the film is based on characters from DC.  Robbie also produced, alongside Bryan Unkeless and Sue Kroll.  The film‚Äôs executive producers are Walter Hamada, Galen Vaisman, Geoff Johns, Hans Ritter and David Ayer. Joining Yan behind the scenes was a creative team comprised of director of photography Matthew Libatique (‚ÄúA Star Is Born,‚Äù ‚ÄúVenom‚Äù); production designer K.K. Barrett (‚ÄúHer‚Äù); editor Jay Cassidy (‚ÄúAmerican Hustle,‚Äù ‚ÄúSilver Linings Playbook‚Äù) and editor Evan Schiff (‚ÄúJohn Wick Chapters 2 & 3‚Äù); and costume designer Erin Benach (‚ÄúA Star Is Born‚Äù).  The music is by Daniel Pemberton (‚ÄúSpider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse‚Äù). Warner Bros. Pictures Presents a LuckyChap Entertainment Production, a Clubhouse Pictures Production, a Kroll & Co. Entertainment Production, ‚ÄúBirds of Prey (and the Fantabulous Emancipation of One Harley Quinn).‚Äù  Opening in theaters and IMAX nationwide on February 7, 2020, the film will be distributed by Warner Bros.

The Prize, which is named to honor one of the world‚Äôs greatest humorists, was given at a gala performance featuring some of the biggest names in comedy. https://www.kennedy-center.org/pages/specialevents/marktwainDave Chappelle is an internationally recognized stand-up comedian and actor whose trademark wit and sharp, irreverent social commentary explores race, popular culture, sex, drugs, politics, and fame. Arguably the most-touring comic on the circuit, Chappelle has performed more than 1,600 concerts worldwide in the past four years, selling out shows within minutes of their announcements.Dave Chappelle could always make people laugh. Once he realized the power of his natural talent, he set some ambitious goals for his art. As a 14-year-old student at Washington, D.C.'s Duke Ellington School of the Arts, Chappelle crafted his stand-up comedy act out of the realities of his life growing up Black in the nation's capital.ABOUT THE MARK TWAIN PRIZEThe Mark Twain Prize recognizes people who have had an impact on American society in ways similar to the distinguished 19th century novelist and essayist best known as Mark Twain. As a social commentator, satirist and creator of memorable characters, Samuel Clemens was a fearless observer of society, who startled and outraged many while delighting and informing many more with his uncompromising perspective of social injustice and personal folly. He revealed the great truth of humor when he said against the assault of laughter nothing can stand.The inaugural Mark Twain Prize was presented to Richard Pryor during the first annual Kennedy Center Celebration of American Humor, October 20, 1998. The event was created by the John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts, Bob Kaminsky, Peter Kaminsky, Mark Krantz, and John Schreiber and is televised annually. The Kennedy Center is grateful to Cappy McGarr for his steadfast support of the Mark Twain Prize for American Humor since its inception. Previous recipients of the Mark Twain include Richard Pryor (1998), Jonathan Winters (1999), Carl Reiner (2000), Whoopi Goldberg (2001), Bob Newhart (2002), Lily Tomlin (2003), Lorne Michaels (2004), Steve Martin (2005), Neil Simon (2006), Billy Crystal (2007), George Carlin (2008), Bill Cosby (2009, rescinded in 2018) Tina Fey (2010), Will Ferrell (2011), Ellen DeGeneres (2012), Carol Burnett (2013) Jay Leno (2014), Eddie Murphy (2015), Bill Murray (2016), David Letterman (2017), and Julia Louis-Dreyfus (2018). #MarkTwainPrize #DaveChappelle #MTPSubscribe to The Kennedy Center! http://bit.ly/2gNFrtb",7,Entertainment,3,15,Friday

When a grisly murder shocks the city, Detective Tiago Vega (Daniel Zovatto) and his partner Lewis Michener (Nathan Lane) become embroiled in an epic story that reflects the rich history of Los Angeles: from the building of the city's first freeways and its deep traditions of Mexican-American folklore, to the dangerous espionage actions of the Third Reich and the rise of radio evangelism. Before long, Tiago and his family are grappling with powerful forces that threaten to tear them apart.

One night, he makes the mistake of drunkenly dropping an inflammatory barb on a broadcast of Skizm, an illegal death-match fight club streamed live to the public. In response, Riktor (Ned Dennehy), the maniacal mastermind behind the channel, decides to force Miles' hand (or hands, as it were) and have him join the fun. Miles wakes to find heavy pistols bolted into his bones, and learns Nix (Samara Weaving), the trigger-happy star of Skizm, is his first opponent. Gleefully echoing elements of Edgar Wright's Scott Pilgrim vs. the World, the Purge franchise, and videogames like Mortal Kombat, Guns Akimbo is hilariously dark, viciously violent, and potentially ‚Äî chillingly ‚Äî prescient.

Team Hi (James Pumphrey & Zach Jobe) get the expensive parts and Team Low (Nolan Sykes & Aaron Parker) get the cheap ones. Then we test them to see which components are actually worth spending the money on. If you want more power out of your Z, you really have to go forced induction. Which basically means, forcing more air into the engine to get more combustion. So in this episode we're installing turbochargers.Hi Team went with a Jim Wolf Technologies twin turbo kit. It‚Äôs high quality across the board. Best materials, it‚Äôs been through lots of R&D, everything should bolt up easily. But it‚Äôs $8000 DOLLARS! That‚Äôs more than we paid for the actual car! Can that possibly be worth it?It comes with two Garrett GT25 turbos. Garrett is one of the most trusted brands of turbo. It also comes with all the piping, plumbing and pieces you could ever ask for. Sometimes with these kits, the plumbing won‚Äôt fit quite right so you‚Äôll find yourself having to do fabrication or calling your friend who knows how to weld. But with this expensive kit, theoretically everything should bolt right up and we won‚Äôt have to get our Tinker Boyz on. Part of that $8000 price tag. It was designed to be an OEM+ set-up with OEM reliability in mind, which means it shouldn‚Äôt require a lot of attention from you once its in--another benefit. It comes with its‚Äô own piggyback box which talks with the car‚Äôs ECU or computer, and the right one can save you a lot of time and effort.These turbos are good for up to 530 hp, which is beneficial in two ways. If you do choose to go FULL hot boi down the line, you won‚Äôt need to upgrade your turbos, you can just keep these. The other benefit is that because these are way more than what we‚Äôre going to be throwing at them, they‚Äôre not likely to be a failure point.Team Low went with a Rev9 turbo kit, purchased on Amazon for $2400. It‚Äôs a single turbo kit. It comes with a turbonetics 60-1 turbo and a turbonetics evolution 38mm external wastegate. That‚Äôs one of the reasons we chose this kit. The turbocharger itself is the part of any turbo kit that is the most likely to fail. So even though this kit is ‚Äúcheap‚Äù, I know with a name-brand, at least the turbo itself should be fine.This kit only includes the hard parts and doesn‚Äôt come with any software to help tell the ECU what‚Äôs going on. So in addition to the kit, we also had to buy an UpRev software license.We‚Äôre gonna show you our super long journey to get these things installed, then we dyno them to see who makes more power!Check out more Donut Media Videos: https://youtu.be/Pz8IGLgFE2s?list=PLFl907chpCa7c7xUVrvc6iXv-kWfvIdHUSome of our best videos ever are coming out soon, stay tuned so you won't miss a thing!‚ñ∫Subscribe here: http://bit.ly/1JQ3qvOLike us on Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/donutmedia/Click here if you want to learn more about Donut Media: http://www.donut.media/Donut Media is at the center of digital media for the next generation of automotive and motorsports enthusiasts.

A muscle-car drag race, obviously. And one that features over 2,200 horsepower combined. In this video, we pit these three super muscle cars against one another for quarter-mile bragging rights. Which one is the quickest? Watch to find out. Ford Mustang Shelby GT500The Shelby GT500 is a high-performance version of the Mustang coupe available in a single trim level. Essentially a track-ready, street-legal Mustang, it has many performance features not available on the standard-issue car.When you're the top horse in the stable, expectations are high. And nothing short of world-beating performance is expected of the new Mustang Shelby GT500. Since Ford ended production of the previous-generation GT500, Dodge has normalized pony-car extremes with its Challenger Hellcat variations, and Chevrolet has set new records on the crucible of test tracks, Germany's N√ºrburgring, with its Camaro ZL1.The Shelby GT500 appears well equipped to reassert itself as the top horse in the stable. Ford developed a new seven-speed dual-clutch transmission specifically for this engine and fitted huge 16.5-inch-diameter front brake rotors clamped upon with six-piston calipers. The adaptive suspension can adjust to various modes, including settings for track-day heroics or drag-race showdowns.Full 2020 Mustang Shelby GT500 Review: https://www.edmunds.com/ford/shelby-gt500/2020/Dodge Challenger Hellcat RedeyeThere aren't a lot of vehicles we consider to be muscle cars. The 2019 Dodge Challenger, with its outlandish horsepower and classic styling, certainly qualifies. Muscle cars are also known for their lack of practicality, but the Challenger bucks that trend by making fewer sacrifices in everyday usability thanks to its large trunk and relatively spacious rear seats.The new 797-hp SRT Hellcat Redeye is basically the retired Demon but with a slightly detuned V8 and less drag-race-specific hardware. There are also some changes in the supporting trims. All-wheel drive is now available on the base SXT, the Widebody treatment is offered on the R/T Scat Pack, and a new dual-snorkel hood increases the Hellcat output by 10 hp. Some trims also come with fewer standard features and corresponding price drops.Even without these latest changes, the Challenger would have remained one of our favorite vehicles in any class. It doesn't have the corner-carving chops of the Camaro or the Mustang, and we're quite fine with that. Not many cars have this kind of sinister style or performance that won't break the bank or overtly compromise your daily drive.The Challenger may not be as quick or as responsive as the Mustang or the Camaro, but it's always a hoot to drive. The Dodge's sheer size makes in-town maneuvering a bit tough (the wide-body fenders don't help), but the meaty tires and upgraded suspension aid handling and body roll.Full 2019 Dodge Challenger Hellcat Redeye Review: https://www.edmunds.com/dodge/challenger/2019/srt-hellcat-redeye/Chevrolet Camaro ZL1The 2019 Chevrolet Camaro has been refreshed, with new fascias, front and rear lights, and some tweaks to trim-level equipment lists. But the only quality-of-life improvement is the upgrade to Chevy's newest and quickest infotainment system, the aptly named Chevrolet Infotainment 3. Nothing that makes the Camaro a tremendous performer and rewarding car to drive has changed, but nothing that makes it an unappealing choice for daily living has changed either.Spend any time behind the wheel of a Camaro, and you'll quickly realize it's sharper and more purposeful than its American muscle-car rivals, especially when equipped with the 1LE package ‚Äî an assortment of performance upgrades meant to improve handling, steering and braking. For 2019 models, Chevy has expanded the 1LE offering, making it available with all three engine options, including the turbocharged 2.0-liter.In many ways, the Camaro feels like the odd man out in the American muscle-car trinity. The Dodge Challenger has stayed true to form and is basically a rolling couch you can equip with a 797-horsepower V8, while the Ford Mustang has turned into a solid all-arounder with broad appeal for coupe buyers. But the Camaro has become a true sports car with all the ups and downs that entails, essentially abandoning all the traditional muscle-car traits except high-output V8 engines.Full 2019 Chevrolet Camaro ZL1 Review: https://www.edmunds.com/chevrolet/camaro/2019/Subscribe to Edmunds to watch all of the latest videos: https://www.youtube.com/user/Edmundsvideo?sub_confirmation=1#ShelbyGT500 #DodgeChallenger #ChevyCamaro",5,Autos & Vehicles,4,17,Wednesday

In this video, I‚Äôm going to show you six exercises for your chest that you can use as a stand alone chest workout that will take just about ten minutes to complete. You will be working hard. We are going to trade in workout length and junk volume for intensity and effort.To start, you will ideally have access to a dual cable machine. If you do not and are doing this chest workout at home, you can easily substitute these out for resistance bands. The key is that the cables or bands provide an element of resisted adduction which is not found when simply using dumbbells and a bench. You want to choose a weight that you will reach failure in at the 8-10 rep mark. With only transition rest, stand up and adjust the cables up (or the bands) so that you can perform the next chest exercise in this workout; cable crossovers. Here you want to choose a 10-12 rep max and work each arm to failure. Don‚Äôt worry if you find that due to the fatigue you are only able to get out 8 or 9 reps. The key is that the drop sets are set up in such a way that it is meant to accommodate your fatigue and allow you to do some work where you wouldn‚Äôt previously be able to do any.Finally, the third exercise in this first circuit is the pushup. When doing these, you want to once again rep out until failure. The idea here is to not just push your body away from the ground but to think of it as squeezing yourself off the ground. This will engage more of the chest and work on recruiting more chest fibers as you incorporate an element of resisted adduction.This whole first drop set should take you somewhere around two and a half minutes to complete.Next, move immediately over to the second chest workout circuit.This one starts with a pair of dumbbells and the floor press exercise. Again, the weight used here should be something that challenges you and causes you to reach failure in the 8-10 rep range. Go to failure on this exercise and then pick up one of the dumbbells for the second adduction focused exercise of the workout; the Cavaliere Crossover.Perform 12 reps on each arm and then head over to the dip station for the final exercise in the workout. If you don‚Äôt have access to a dip station you can easily perform this at home in the corner of a kitchen counter. Do your dips until you reach failure and your second circuit is done. Once again, this entire circuit should take you about two and a half minutes with the entire workout clocking in around 5 minutes to this point.From here, head back to the original circuit and perform it for a second round. Do the same for the second circuit as well. If you have to adjust the weights down slightly to accommodate the mounting fatigue you may do so. Keep in mind, the most important thing you can do is keep the effort level high and take your sets to failure.At the end, you should be done in about 10-12 minutes tops. You do have the option to to through this one more round for a total of 18 high effort sets and a workout time that will barely surpass 15 minutes. The key to the effectiveness of this chest workout is that it is condensing the amount of work being done by the muscles into a shorter period of time. This type of workload can have a stimulatory effect on the muscle and lead to muscle hypertrophy through multiple mechanisms, one of which being a metabolic training benefit.Try this out and let me know how you like it.

We acknowledge that this is destined to become a ‚Äúso bad, it‚Äôs good‚Äù cult classic, but that‚Äôs clearly not what the filmmakers or studio had intended.

Bake the french fries at 185 degrees for 5 hours, until fully dehydrated.2. Heat a large pot full of salted water on high. Grind the french fries in a food processor until smooth then use a spoon to push through a strainer to ensure there are no large pieces. 3. In a mixing bowl, stir together the semolina flour and ‚Öî cups of ground french fry crumbs. Add half your water and mix with your hands until a shaggy dough forms. Add the rest of the water and knead with your hands for a few minutes until dough is smooth and doesn‚Äôt stick to your hands. If the dough is too dry to from a solid ball, knead in a few drops of water. If the dough is too wet and sticks to your hands, knead in a few pinches of semolina flour. Form finished dough into a ball, wrap in plastic wrap, and let set in the fridge for at least half an hour.4. Unwrap rested dough then feed it through a Kitchenaid macaroni extruder while cutting off the pasta tubes at ¬æ inch intervals. Dust a pan with extra semolina flour to catch the noodles.5. Drop in salted boiling water for 4 minutes and strain to reserve for later.Caramelized OnionsIngredients:- 1 Tbsp butter- 1 whole white onion- 1/2 tsp salt- 1/2 Tbsp sugar1. Melt butter on high in a medium sauce pot then add in onions, sugar, and salt. Stir and continue to cook on medium-high for 15 minutes until a deep caramel color has formed. If the onions start to burn, add in a ¬º cup of water and stir.Thousand IslandIngredients:- 1 cup mayo- 1/2 cup ketchup- 1/4 cup finely chopped dill pickles- 1/2 tsp paprika- 1/4 tsp onion powder- 1/4 tsp garlic powder1. Chop dill pickles as finely as humanly possible then whisk together with mayo, ketchup, chopped pickles paprika, onion powder, and garlic powder. You can always substitute relish for dill pickles but it doesn‚Äôt have the same bite. Animal-Style Cheese SauceIngredients:- 3 Tbsp butter - 2 ¬Ω Tbsp flour- 16 oz whole milk- 12 slices American cheese- 4 ounces shredded medium cheddar cheese- 1/2 cup Thousand Island1. Melt butter in a small sauce pot on medium then add flour and stir. Cook for about two minutes until a light blonde color is reached. Add in milk, stir, and cook for about two minutes until sauce has visibly thickened. Add American cheese and cheddar and stir until melted. Take off the heat then add in Thousand Island.Finishing the Animal-Style Mac ‚Äòn‚Äô CheeseIngredients:- 1/2 cup vegetable oil- 1 cup finely chopped french fries- Cooked macaroni noodles- Animal-Style cheese sauce- Thousand Island- 4 slices American Cheese- Caramelized onions1. Preheat oven to 500 degrees. Heat the oil in a sautee pan until it moves freely across the pan then add your chopped french fries and fry until crispy, about 30-45 seconds. Strain and reserve.2. Stir together macaroni noodles and Animal-Style cheese sauce to your desired cheesy noodly levels. Either portion out into individual baking dishes or one larger baking dish.3. Top with crispy french fry bits and bake for 10 minutes, just until piping hot and molten.4. Remove from the oven and immediately top with a slice of american cheese, a hefty smattering of Thousand Island, and Caramelized onions. 5. Eat it, but please wait for it to cool a bit because we don‚Äôt need another burnt tongue lawsuit on our hands :(",1,Entertainment,1,11,Monday

Does more expensive mean more better? We‚Äôre gonna find out once and for all.Donut bought two identical Nissan 350z‚Äôs, and for the past few weeks have been modifying them to be FUN, daily drivers that you can take to the track.Team Low (Nolan Sykes & Aaron Parker) got a bunch of really cheap parts and in the end got  a slammed turbo z that shoots flames all for around $13,000.Team Hi (James Pumphrey & Zach Jobe) on the other hand, got a bunch of really nice expensive stuff totaling an astounding $33,000.  Then we tested them to see which components are actually worth spending the money on. We‚Äôre gonna break down the cost of building these two cars, test them head to head on track, and decide which is better. Low Car got a set of eBay coilovers of unknown origin,  and Hi Car was treated to a set of KW V3s. Next, we installed wheels and tires. Hi Car got some sick Advan RGIII‚Äôs wrapped in Bridgestone RE71s. Meanwhile on the Low Car, We bought some XXR 527s, and decided to run Federal RS-RR tires. In the end, both cars were able to achieve supercar-level braking distance by switching to super sticky rubber. Nolan and Aaron installed more aggressive brake pads, steel braided brake lines, flushed and replaced the brake fluid, and bled the lines. Over on Hi Car, Zach and James replaced the car‚Äôs entire braking system with a 6 piston, 13 brake kit from Wilwood. After that we went inside our Zs, installing racing seats. The Hi Car got two Sparco QRT-R seats, a Greddy steering wheel, and a hub to make it removable. Lo Car received some Corbeau DFXs racing seats.Next, both cars were fitted with modified differentials to make sick skids easier. Hi Car got a very trick Kaaz 2-way differential. Zach spent a lot of time adjusting the spacing, making sure it was perfect. Over on Lo Car we took a different route. Instead of installing a new differential, we welded ours together!After making a bunch of performance upgrades, it was time to alter the looks of our beloved Zs.

I just like painting on things üòÇ PLUS, I feel like a lot of challenges these days have gotten really pointless. But, this one is good haha. I decided to try  to paint and decorate different things for 24 hours. I have a lot of art supplies laying around my art room, just begging to be painted. But I don't often have the time to paint that much at a time. So this was a great opportunity to put a bunch of it to good use finally.I am going to be painting on a seashell, painting a pencil pouch, painting a rock, painting a squishy (mini squishy makeover lol), making a custom mug, decorating a giant clothes pin and a surprise weird item LOL.

0bTsLSN0-68,Larry Bird and Bill Laimbeer have genuinely hated each other for over 30 years,2020-01-25 15:54:11,UCDRmGMSgrtZkOsh_NQl4_xw,SB Nation,17,2020-01-26,nba|beef|beef history|larry bird|bill laimbeer|isiah thomas|michael jordan|detroit pistons|pistons|boston celtics|celtics|nba playoffs|1980s nba,421082,11960,213,1166,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/0bTsLSN0-68/default.jpg,False,False,"Larry Bird and Bill Laimbeer stood in the middle of an intense Celtics-Pistons rivalry spanning the late 1980s and early 1990s. But the individual feud between those two wasn't just a battle within that war. It was personal. It was beef.Starting with his trade to the Pistons in the early 1980s, Laimbeer built a reputation as not just a strong rebounder and scorer, but a relentless pest. On one hand, he'd make dirty and dangerous plays, then act like nothing had happened. On the other hand, he'd flop and whine to bait the referees into calling fouls on his opponents. Nobody despised Laimbeer for this quite as much as Bird did. Bird's public campaign against Laimbeer's style of play dated back to the Celtics-Pistons playoff series in 1985, and really took off after Laimbeer started a brawl by fouling Bird hard in the 1987 playoffs. Bird accused Laimbeer of intentionally trying to injure him, and never withdrew the accusation. Even decades later, these two NBA legends maintain an icy distance because of how things played out on the court. This beef might never end, so in this episode, we learn about what built it.Written and produced by Seth RosenthalDirected and edited by Jiazhen ZhangSubscribe: https://goo.gl/NbabaeCheck out our full video catalog: https://goo.gl/9pMHRVVisit our playlists: https://goo.gl/NvpZFFLike SB Nation on Facebook: https://goo.gl/Pzcs7OFollow on Twitter: https://goo.gl/5LI02DFollow on Instagram: https://goo.gl/aY2FFKExplore SB Nation: http://www.sbnation.com",7,Sport,1,15,Saturday

Why in the world would we tell you to make meatballs, brown them, and then break them into pieces‚Äîfor a rag√π? Sounds crazy, but it‚Äôs the best way we found to sear a big batch of meat without overcooking it. This MeatballMethod‚Ñ¢ yields deep color (a.k.a. flavor) along with tender meat. If you want to use fresh pasta, go for it, you overachiever you. We also tested the recipe with no-boil noodles, but found they soak up a lot more sauce and the lasagna loses its wonderful ooziness; instead, we recommend the regular dried stuff.heck out the recipe here: https://www.bonappetit.com/recipe/ba-best-lasagnaWant Bon App√©tit shirts, hats and more? https://shop.bonappetit.com/?utm_source=youtube&utm_brand=ba&utm_campaign=aud-dev&utm_medium=video&utm_content=merch-shop-promoStill haven‚Äôt subscribed to Bon App√©tit on YouTube? ‚ñ∫‚ñ∫ http://bit.ly/1TLeyPnWant more Bon App√©tit in your life?

However, as the city, located in central China's Hubei Province, is now hosting the vast majority of the confirmed cases of novel coronavirus pneumonia, medical staff across hospitals in Wuhan have faced up to their responsibilities regardless of the risks and sacrifices.On the early morning of Saturday, the first day of the Chinese Lunar New Year, the country's grandest traditional festival that was supposed to be filled with fun activities and events, doctors and nurses from the Jinyintan Hospital did not even have time to take a rest.Ding Na is a nurse working in the ICU of the hospital, one that has been at the frontier of the battle for nearly a month since it took in the first infected patient on Dec 29 last year.Her husband is a physician who works on a different floor in the same building. However, over the past 28 days, they did not quite have any chance to meet each other nor much time to rest at home.This has lead to the husband's locker becoming a mail box for the couple to keep in touch and care for each other.I come here every day to bring him tidy clothes here and take away the dirty ones home, as she told the China Central Television (CCTV) reporter.Knowing well about the threat they faced in the fight against the virus better than anyone, the medical workers have still chosen to stick to their duties and try their best to free the patients away from the pain.I hope with our efforts, we are able to control the epidemic at an earlier date so that none of our families, colleagues, friends and fellow citizens suffer anymore, said Guo Wei, deputy head of infection division from Tongji Hospital affiliated to Tongji Medical College of Huazhong University of Science and Technology.Subscribe to our YouTube channel: https://bit.ly/2TwO8GmQUICKTAKE ON SOCIAL:Follow QuickTake on Twitter: twitter.com/quicktakeLike QuickTake on Facebook: facebook.com/quicktakeFollow QuickTake on Instagram: instagram.com/quicktakeSubscribe to our newsletter: https://bit.ly/2FJ0oQZEmail us at quicktakenews@gmail.comQuickTake by Bloomberg is a global news network delivering up-to-the-minute analysis on the biggest news, trends and ideas for a new generation of leaders.",7,News & Politics,2,9,Sunday

Lessons learned from the SARS epidemic nearly two decades ago may help them in developing a vaccine. It's a race against time before the virus has a chance to mutate. Global concerns over the virus are mounting, as more cases are identified abroad. Germany has now confirmed its first case of the virus. More than a dozen other countries are also reporting infections. In China the death toll has jumped to 100, with more than 45-hundred confirmed cases. Domestic travel bans are already in place, and now the government has asked people to delay foreign travel.

While on a forgettable first date together in Ohio, a black man (Get Out‚Äôs Daniel Kaluuya) and a black woman (Jodie Turner-Smith, in her first starring feature-film role), are pulled over for a minor traffic infraction. The situation escalates, with sudden and tragic results, when the man kills the police officer in self-defense. Terrified and in fear for their lives, the man, a retail employee, and the woman, a criminal defense lawyer, are forced to go on the run. But the incident is captured on video and goes viral, and the couple unwittingly become a symbol of trauma, terror, grief and pain for people across the country. As they drive, these two unlikely fugitives will discover themselves and each other in the most dire and desperate of circumstances, and will forge a deep and powerful love that will reveal their shared humanity and shape the rest of their lives. Joining a legacy of films such as Bonnie and Clyde and Thelma & Louise, Queen & Slim is a powerful, consciousness-raising love story that confronts the staggering human toll of racism and the life-shattering price of violence. Waithe wrote the script based on an original idea by bestselling author James Frey (A Million Little Pieces, Katerina). The feature-film directorial debut from Melina Matsoukas (executive producer of HBO‚Äôs Insecure) stars Academy Award¬Æ nominee Daniel Kaluuya as ‚ÄúSlim‚Äù and rising star Jodie Turner-Smith (Syfy‚Äôs Nightflyers), as ‚ÄúQueen.‚Äù Waithe produces the film via her company, Hillman Grad Productions, along with Matsoukas via her production company, De La Revoluci√≥n Films. Frey produces via his production company, 3BlackDot, alongside Andrew Coles and Michelle Knudsen.

Summer 2020 is the time for F9, the ninth chapter in the saga that has endured for almost two decades and has earned more than $5 billion around the world.  Vin Diesel‚Äôs Dom Toretto is leading a quiet life off the grid with Letty and his son, little Brian, but they know that danger always lurks just over their peaceful horizon. This time, that threat will force Dom to confront the sins of his past if he‚Äôs going to save those he loves most. His crew joins together to stop a world-shattering plot led by the most skilled assassin and high-performance driver they‚Äôve ever encountered: a man who also happens to be Dom‚Äôs forsaken brother, Jakob (John Cena, next year‚Äôs The Suicide Squad). F9 sees the return of Justin Lin as director, who helmed the third, fourth, fifth and sixth chapters of the series when it transformed into a global blockbuster. The action hurtles around the globe‚Äîfrom London to Tokyo, from Central America to Edinburgh, and from a secret bunker in Azerbaijan to the teeming streets of Tblisi. Along the way, old friends will be resurrected, old foes will return, history will be rewritten, and the true meaning of family will be tested like never before.  The film stars returning cast members Michelle Rodriguez, Tyrese Gibson, Chris ‚ÄúLudacris‚Äù Bridges, Jordana Brewster, Nathalie Emmanuel and Sung Kang, with Oscar¬Æ winner Helen Mirren and Oscar¬Æ winner Charlize Theron. F9 also features Grammy-winning superstar Cardi B as new franchise character Leysa, a woman with a connection to Dom‚Äôs past, and a cameo by Reggaeton sensation Ozuna.  F9 is produced by Neal H. Moritz, Vin Diesel, Jeff Kirschenbaum, Joe Roth, Justin Lin, Clayton Townsend and Samantha Vincent.  www.thefastsaga.com",6,Film & Animation,1,21,Friday

The singing competition series is hosted by Nick Cannon and features panelists Jenny McCarthy, Nicole Scherzinger, Ken Jeong and Robin Thicke.The show features celebrities facing off against one another with one major twist: each singer is shrouded from head to toe in an elaborate costume, complete with full face mask to conceal his or her identity. Season Two boasts 16 celebrity singers in all-new costumes and masks, including The Flamingo, The Leopard and The Egg.With each performance, the host, panelists, audience, viewers and even the other contestants are left guessing who is singing behind the mask. Ranging from Grammy Award winners to legendary athletes, and everything in between, the singers may attempt to throw the crowd off of their scent, while keen observers might pick up on tiny clues buried throughout the show. One singer will be eliminated each week, ultimately revealing his or her true identity.

By comparison, he added, just $18 million was spent on preparedness in Congo‚Äôs neighbor Uganda before the virus crossed the border.‚ÄúThis must be a lesson for the rest of the world,‚Äù he said.The plea from WHO‚Äôs top official comes as the deadly coronavirus has now killed at least 362 people and sickened more than 17,400 worldwide, including patients in the U.S. and Europe.The respiratory illness, which is capable of spreading through human-to-human contact, is not yet considered a pandemic. A pandemic is ‚Äúan epidemic occurring worldwide, or over a very wide area, crossing international boundaries and usually affecting a large number of people,‚Äù according to WHO. While the new virus has spread to almost two dozen countries, the majority of the cases remain in mainland China.Nevertheless, many global health experts expect the virus will become a pandemic. Since emerging about a month ago in Wuhan, China, the coronavirus has infected more people than the 2003 SARS epidemic, which sickened roughly 8,100 people across the globe over nine months. As of Monday, there are nearly 200 cases in at least 23 countries, outside of China, a handful of which have been transmitted from human contact within those countries.On Thursday, WHO declared the virus a global health emergency after declining to do so at two previous meetings.Tedros said the ‚Äúcontinued increase in cases and the evidence of human-to-human transmission outside of China‚Äù were ‚Äúmost deeply disturbing.‚ÄùFor access to live and exclusive video from CNBC subscribe to CNBC PRO: https://www.cnbc.com/pro/?__source=youtube ¬ª Subscribe to CNBC TV: https://cnb.cx/SubscribeCNBCtelevision¬ª Subscribe to CNBC: https://cnb.cx/SubscribeCNBC¬ª Subscribe to CNBC Classic: https://cnb.cx/SubscribeCNBCclassic Turn to CNBC TV for the latest stock market news and analysis.

Add the water and 1 tablespoon of olive oil and continue to mix with a fork until a dough forms. 2) Lightly flour a cutting board or clean counter surface and turn the dough out. Use your hands to knead the dough for 5 minutes. If the dough is too wet and sticks to your hands, add more flour. 3) Use the remaining olive oil to grease the bottom of a mixing bowl. Add the dough to the bowl then wrap in plastic, OR COVER THE BOWL WITH YOUR MYTHICAL KITCHEN TOWEL ;-), and let set out at room temp for at least two hours (make your sauce during this time!). Either use immediately or throw in the fridge for up to 3 days. Step 2: SauceIngredients:* 1/2 cup peanut butter* 1 cup chicken stock* 1 Tbsp canola oil* ‚Öì cup chopped onion * 2 minced garlic cloves * 2 Tbsp tomato paste* ¬Ω tsp salt* ¬º tsp chili flake* ¬º tsp dried thyme* ¬Ω tsp Maggi seasoning (substitute soy sauce if you can‚Äôt find it)1) Warm chicken stock in a small sauce pot and add peanut butter. Whisk together until combined.2) Heat oil in an additional medium sauce pot on medium-high and add onions, garlic, chili flake, salt, tomato paste, and dried thyme and sautee for 10 minutes until vegetables are softened. Add in your peanut butter and stock mixture and whisk, then add Maggi seasoning (or, to reiterate, soy sauce).Step 3: Top and BakeIngredients:* 2/3 cup grape jelly* ¬º cup red wine vinegar* ¬Ω fresh habanero pepper* 15 or so grapes, sliced in half * 1 portion pizza dough* ¬Ω tsp olive oil* 1 portion sauce * 10-ish pepperoni slices* 1 block low-moisture mozzarella1) Preheat your oven to 450 degrees. Heat a small sauce pot on medium high. Add red wine vinegar and jelly to the pot and whisk until the jelly is melted and smooth. Add the habanero and allow it to steep.2) Drop in your grapes and poach for about 15 minutes, or until the grapes are soft and infused with the jelly. 3) Flour a surface and use your hands to press the pizza dough into a round. Grab the edges of the pizza dough and quickly turn your hands around the edges to form a sturdy crust and a thin center. Use a rolling pin to create it if you need to! There‚Äôs no shame in that game!4) Oil the bottom of a round pizza pan then stretch your dough over the top until the crusts fit the edges of the pan. Oil the crust as well. 5) Spread a layer of the peanut butter sauce over top of the dough, then add cheese, pepperoni, and bake for about 10 minutes until the crust gets nicely browned. 6) Remove the pizza and top with poached grapes as well as some of that sweet spicy grape jelly syrup. Slice and enjoy‚Äîassuming you‚Äôre into that type of thing.",3,Entertainment,1,11,Friday

This Is What Happened To Her Brain. ‚ñ∫ https://youtu.be/QiBpKuTrFrwThis is a case of beer potomania, which is a very specific case of hypotonic hyponatremia. Humans need solute in order to produce urine. These solutes are predominantly sodium, potassium and urea, along with others. Beer contains little to no sodium or potassium. Drinking only 50 beers daily for weeks causes solute loss, on top of vitamin deficiency and poor nutrition.Slowly as sodium is depleted, more volume from beer is accumulated in the body.Beer contains water, alcohol and carbohydrates, the latter which induces an insulin response in the body to prevent muscle catabolism.Muscle catabolism could count as protein that would produce urea, but because of insulin response, it doesn't happen, further exacerbating solute loss.The accumulation of water in the body and depletion of solute leads to chronic hyponatremia. This is because the kidneys need solute exchange in the process of urine production. If these solutes are absent, minimal urine is produced, and the urine that is produced is maximally dilute (eg low specific gravity) Neurologic sequelae from low sodium presence in blood include seizures and is an emergency.In this patient, it wasn't clear whether he was suffering withdrawal syndrome, chronic hyponatremia, or both. In the case as it happened, the hospital ran out of medicines for the SE because it was so frequent, and needed to borrow twice from neighboring hospitals.Osmotic demyelination syndrome appears to have a higher risk in patients who have more electrolyte abnormalities and metabolic derangements. Please see references for more information.These cases are patients who I, or my colleagues have seen. They are de-identified and many instances have been presented in more depth in an academic setting. These videos are not individual medical advice and are for general educational purposes only.  I do not give medical advice over the internet, see your own physician in person for that.Additional radiology images provided by Radiopaedia and Wellcome CollectionReferences:[0] An experimental study of the etiology of rum fits and delirium tremens.

Over three months of getting to know him, he taught me about what it means to fight for your life, to love unconditionally and to appreciate every single breath. He always wanted to start a YouTube channel and I told him that no matter what, his story would be told. He took comfort in that. Here is that story. I know he's here with us.

I think that they are incredibly relatable as you can catch the humor even as a patient. I will say that some of the memes can be mean and if taken out of context can even seem rude BUT we need to understand that this is medical satire. Being able to laugh at ourselves and our troubles is a healthy habit to practice. I really enjoy reacting to these memes and I know that there are millions more out there that are as funny. Please if you enjoy this series let me know by liking, commenting, and sharing this video with your friends/family.

A few months ago, I found out that Amazon started offering a personal shopping service. That's right, Amazon was styling people for a small fee each month - so I figured, we had to try it out to see what kind of clothing & accessories they would send me, and if they would be any good. So we took a quiz and good ole' Bezos sent me a sack of clothes. What do you guys think of my Amazon personal shopper haul? EDIT (for clarity) - although I eliminated most color options in the quiz, I did leave on every pattern except animal print, I said that I often wear edgy styles and I also liked boho styles, said that I would try pretty much every trend except for animal print and cropped pants, and clicked yes on multiple silhouettes and clothing items - so they had plenty of optionality! just in case you guys missed some answers!This video is NOT sponsored!You can check out our Colourpop frankenlipsticks here! https://colourpop.com/collections/safiya-nygaard-makeupSafiya's Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/safiyany/Twitter: https://twitter.com/safiyajnFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/safnygaard/Check out our merch here: https://fiendsbysaf.com/If your size is sold out, sign up for email updates!MUSICVia AudioNetworkAssistant EditorsEmily Linden & Josie Latino",2,People & Blogs,0,5,Wednesday

They‚Äôre all important parts of the tale of the axion - a tale whose end may take us beyond the standard model and solve one of the most vexing mysteries in astrophysics. Hosted by Matt O'DowdWritten by Matt O'Dowd & Graeme GosselGraphics by Leonardo Scholzer & Adriano LealPost Production: Yago Ballarini, Max Willians, Pedro OsinskiDirected by: Andrew KornhaberExecutive Producers: Eric Brown & Andrew KornhaberThe story of the axion is a classic physics tale: intrepid scientists delve deep into trackless mathematics in search of answers to a mystery. And there, against all expectations, they find the hint of a completely new and unexpected denizen of the natural world. In this case the mystery was a subtle inconsistency in the behavior of the fundamental forces. And the unexpected discovery? A brand new particle - the axion - which, while not proven to exist, may explain a much more famous conundrum. The axion may explain dark matter.

Very quickly into that Micah Rolls the Polaris Rs1 crashing it. Luckily there was no damage. Ben then tests his New Ford Raptor's offroad capabilities by taking it on the same trails that we had our RS1 on but the raptor was too heavy and ends up falling through the snow and getting stuck lol. Comment down below what you would like to see us get on the new RS1 and also if you read all this comment Get a turbo for it,2,People & Blogs,1,1,Tuesday

After buying the cheapest Yaris we could find, we big blocked it with a 1.8L and then slapped on the cheapest turbo in the world for $169. We ran up an incredible 200HP (150kw) at the wheels with Yaris Hilton. But our first street drive brought about a strange knocking sound from under the hood. In this episode we find out what went wrong, then add some wheels, tyres and lowered springs to get Yaris Hilton finished for the first proper street drive...Be sure to check out the MCM Facebook Page and Shop‚ñ∫http://www.facebook.com/mightycarmods‚ñ∫http://www.mightycarmods.com/collections/‚úåÔ∏è JDM Air Fresheners https://mightycarmods.com/collections/accessories/products/mcm-car-air-freshenerüëï BRAND NEW Engine Heart T-shirt https://mightycarmods.com/collections/clothing/products/engine-heart-t-shirtüîî Hit the bell next to Subscribe so you don't miss a video!Also something to note around Mighty Car Mods: we are normal guys and are not trained mechanics.
